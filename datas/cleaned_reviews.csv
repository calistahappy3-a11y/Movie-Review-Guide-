Please Give,"Keener, Peet and Hall all shine as women plagued with self-doubt who respond to those insecurities in strikingly different ways.",Comedy
Please Give,"An edgy, somber, beautifully written Manhattan fable of guilt, shame, infidelity, death and real estate.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener always gives us more to chew on than originally meets the eye in her films and she writes female characters with an intelligence, sensitivity and realism that blows the Sex and the City foursome away any day of the week.",Comedy
Please Give,"The tone is low-key but very funny. Yet, at the same time, the film also manages to have a sardonic edge.",Comedy
Please Give,"Of a piece with Nicole Holofcener's three other films -- talky, urbane ensemble flicks that elicit quiet but deeply sincere smiles and laughs, and just as often showcase hushed moments of pinprick vulnerability.",Comedy
Please Give,"A witty and observant comedy of manners, Please Give is another understated gem from writer-director Nicole Holofcener.",Comedy
Please Give,Solid ensemble work with an especially good Catherine Keener.,Comedy
Please Give,"It's a tricky kind of social satire, its possibly cloying self-absorption cut only by some winningly awkward characters.",Comedy
Please Give,"The fourth teaming of gifted indie filmmaker Holofcener and talented actress Keener is a timely, sharply observed, femme-driven serio-comedy about postmodern capitalistic lifestyles with all their joys, guilts, complexities and contradictions.",Comedy
Please Give,"Ah, the guilt of the privileged.",Comedy
Please Give,An engagingly high-strung comedy about lack of empathy and the gnawing guilt that can attend it.,Comedy
Please Give,Holofcener's humorous interest in yupscale entitlem.ent and its discontents mark her as a descendant of Woody Allen,Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is specific about its middle-class, white, Manhattan characters but it's also universal in the way one social class' anxieties are understood rather than simply celebrated.",Comedy
Please Give,One of the best movies ever about guilt as the guardian of our goodness and a sign of our yearning to belong to the larger world.,Comedy
Please Give,"[Holofcener] has real sympathy -- characters that might have been brittle, mockable creations in another writer-director's hands gain resonance here.",Comedy
Please Give,"At a time when every penny counts, where do they come up with the money to finance a movie this boring?",Comedy
Please Give,"Such fine-tuned observation requires the ideal interpreter. Keener has always been Holofcener's muse, and once again offers the sort of fully crafted portrait that reminds us how shallow most movies really are.",Comedy
Please Give,"With her new film, the poignant and funny Please Give, Holofcener is at the top of her game.",Comedy
Please Give,"Sometimes -- and far too rarely -- a film will hit all the right notes, with sharp, original dialogue, brilliant casting and an absorbing story. So caught up in its spell, you dread seeing the credits roll. Please Give is that movie.",Comedy
Please Give,"Listening to the banter in Please Give feels like eavesdropping on natural conversations, shaped and selected by a skilled storyteller.",Comedy
Please Give,"With the romantic notion of the deceased 'haunting' their furniture..., the director at once adds some ethereal spirituality and an earthbound connection between people and their possessions.",Comedy
Please Give,"Keener, Peet, and Hall are so strong, so empathetic even at their weakes",Comedy
Please Give,Some people might find it distasteful to make a movie about guilty rich folks who give themselves permission to splurge. Others will rightly appreciate the honesty.,Comedy
Please Give,Holofcener's deliciously understated film takes a miniaturist's pleasure in getting the details right.,Comedy
Please Give,"One of the best movies of the year so far. An insightful, darkly funny and multi-layered character study about class and family.",Comedy
Please Give,"Few American filmmakers create female characters as realistically funny, attractively imperfect and flat-out annoying as does Ms. Holofcener.",Comedy
Please Give,"Hardly a treasure, but it offers some modest rewards.",Comedy
Please Give,Two possible ways of regarding Please Give: It's shallow. Or maybe it's deeply shallow.,Comedy
Please Give,"If giving is always a relationship, giving also entails taking, whether in business, romance or family interactions.",Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is Holofcener's best movie to date. The slender plot presents itself without fuss, a slice of Manhattan life, a la Woody Allen's early, most engaging work.",Comedy
Please Give,"This gorgeous film, always tender and sometimes dark, is a deeply resonant comic drama that's concerned with nothing less than life, death, love, sex, guilt and the urban logic of mortality.",Comedy
Please Give,"Fleetingly amusing, charming and harmless with a terrific cast, but often meanders, lacks bite, and unevenly juggles comedy, drama and romance.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener's touch isn't light, but it is funny in its exploration of materialism and guilt, vanity and aging.",Comedy
Please Give,"[Although] I think Holofcener's work is always interesting, I think this is the least satisfying of all her films I've seen.",Comedy
Please Give,"Brutally honest about the way people behave, and often devastatingly funny in its observations.",Comedy
Please Give,Don't be put off by the bitchy-familiar chick-flick wrapper. This one's a keeper.,Comedy
Please Give,Funny and heartbreaking.,Comedy
Please Give,"Forget the dreaded ""Sex and the City 2."" Holofcener's wonderful new film about mammograms, marriage, infidelity, child-rearing and waiting for the old lady next door to die so you can buy her sprawling, pre-WWII apartment is the most sophisticated America",Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is a moral comedy that feels at times like one of the late Eric Rohmer's deceptively breezy miniatures, or a mid-period Woody Allen movie - the fussiness.",Comedy
Please Give,"In its casual, disarming way, it's as deep and as grand a film as you'll find",Comedy
Please Give,Holofcener explores the contemporary female experience with a camera that is at once empathetic and merciless.,Comedy
Please Give,This is one of those rare movies that made me want to thank the person who did it.,Comedy
Please Give,"The movie is about imperfect characters in a difficult world, who mostly do the best they can under the circumstances, but not always. Do you realize what a revolutionary approach that is for a movie these days?",Comedy
Please Give,"It's a wonderful movie full of people you wish you knew in real life, and like most of Holofcener's movies, it's a remarkable combination of comedy and tragedy.",Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is a series of such set-piece scenes, a breezy, though not negligible, exploration of the contest between avarice and empathy.",Comedy
Please Give,Only Rebecca Hall comes through with a genuineness that rises above Holofcener's doodlings.,Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give proves that a film can be a spectacularly rewarding experience by just providing time spent with well-written, believable adult characters.",Comedy
Please Give,It recognizes that a film about unpleasant people need not be unpleasant itself as long as it remembers not to make them uninteresting as well.,Comedy
Please Give,"As she has in four previous films, Holofcener smartly relies on Keener's talent to create a layered character who is neurotic and often inappropriate, but still good at her core.",Comedy
Please Give,"Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener has sprinkled in quite a lot of humor, without which the film may have been too overbearing. But it's not, and we enjoy the characters, partly because, in this 90 minute effort, they don't wear out their welcome.",Comedy
Please Give,"Yet another ramble through the tiny world of the affluent and the idle, a particular fascination of Holofcener's. The only difference this time is the increased emphasis on morbidity.",Comedy
Please Give,"While Holofcener's scenes are profoundly accurate and wildly amusing, they hit home like a sledge hammer to those of us who share these feelings.",Comedy
Please Give,The combination of good-nature and light snark [make] Please Give maybe the strongest film of Holofcener's career.,Comedy
Please Give,"There's nothing wrong with asking audiences to make up their own minds, but Please Give doesn't even ask.",Comedy
Please Give,Some filmmakers make movies that hold up a mirror to nature. Nicole Holofcener makes seriocomedies that hold up a magnifying glass to human nature.,Comedy
Please Give,The film's premise yields a story that's insightful and engaging while touching on many other matters of love and money.,Comedy
Please Give,The characters and their varying viewpoints on the haves and have-nots are entertaining and thought-provoking.,Comedy
Please Give,There's no movie around right now with a subject more pertinent. It'll hit you hard.,Comedy
Please Give,Please Give is one of those movies that can be enjoyed simply for its funny portraits of human foibles and fumbling grasps at intimacy -- but it's also deceivingly profound.,Comedy
Please Give,"It's a movie about guilt and family and what we mean when we say something is valuable, all of which are great subjects.",Comedy
Please Give,A funny and pointed take of class anxieties from the Woody Allen school,Comedy
Please Give,"Nobody loves messy, human imperfections quite like writer-director Nicole Holofcener.",Comedy
Please Give,"There are laughs and moments of pain and many instances of embarrassing (and deeply human) behavior throughout, but there's also delicacy and grace...",Comedy
Please Give,"Nicole Holofcener is frequently lauded for writing vivid female characters, but such praise doesn't really do justice to her full game.",Comedy
Please Give,"Touching, intelligent and full of charm and wit.",Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is an almost perfectly rendered slice of life, buoyant with wonderful performances.",Comedy
Please Give,"While the characters contend with their precarious self-images, we can't help but reflect on ourselves as well. To borrow a cautionary phrase about that mirror: 'Objects may appear closer than they are.'",Comedy
Please Give,A tremendous leap forward for filmmaker Nicole Holofcener...,Comedy
Please Give,"[The script is] sharp and witty, but never forced, and features some of the best pure dialogue you'll hear this year.",Comedy
Please Give,"In Please Give, Keener is at her best. Let's hope her creative partnership with Holofcener continues.",Comedy
Please Give,"While Please Give is a film about conscience, it's also slyly funny, with piercing moments of insight and warmth.",Comedy
Please Give,"In a Holofcener film, the usual rules of screenwriting do not apply, which lends her work a lifelike quality that's particularly refreshing in this era of formulaic remakes and sequels.",Comedy
Please Give,"Give thrives because of these professional efforts, which help to mold something strangely poignant and thrillingly neurotic out of a plot that should rightfully be nothing more than a cinematic air horn.",Comedy
Please Give,"Happily, the joy outweighs the guilt.",Comedy
Please Give,"Exploring class, generations and misbehaving bodies, Holofcener's dramedy refines its character studies with warmth and wit as she creates warts-and-all individuals whose flawed humanity we warm to.",Comedy
Please Give,"An indie with real pedigree and smarts, Holofcener's comedy of manners is well-observered and well worth watching.",Comedy
Please Give,"Maybe things get worse, but movies like this at least make it easier to handle.",Comedy
Please Give,"There's the rare occasion where the boldness of the dialogue is laid on a little thick and it drags you out of the moment, but it doesn't happen often, and the odd excess is more than forgiveable given just how well the rest of the film works.",Comedy
Please Give,"Trifles, trivialities, frippery and froth. We've got plenty of words to describe things that don't matter. And now, we also have a film. Please Give.",Comedy
Please Give,"Beautifully played and sharply-written, the pleasures on offer here are apparently throwaway but the authenticity of the characters freights the story with a light-hearted realism.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener's biggest ally against nauseating self-pity is Keener, her screen alter ego.",Comedy
Please Give,"Smart and touching, this is a must for lovers of human drama.",Comedy
Please Give,Keener manages to flesh out her character more deeply than the sometimes stage-rash behavior Holofcener demands.,Comedy
Please Give,Starved for whip-smart dialogue and characters who don't behave as though they've just stepped out of a cartoon? Holofcener's latest is guaranteed to please. Give it a look.,Comedy
Please Give,"Enjoyable, emotionally engaging comedy-drama from writer-director Nicole Holofcener, featuring a sharply written script, likeable characters and terrific performances from a talented ensemble cast.",Comedy
Please Give,"Funny yet emotional, tragic yet full of hope, this is the type of character-driven story theatergoers could use to see more of, and as like as Holofcener is around here's hope more is exactly what it is we are going to get.",Comedy
Please Give,"Comes close to justifying the praise it has received -- close, but not entirely.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener allows her strong ensemble room to really explore their characters. Keener and Hall are the obvious standouts, but fresh-faced Sarah Steele is particularly good in support, as Kate's teenage daughter.",Comedy
Please Give,"Nothing earth-shaking goes on here, and Holofcener has the good sense not to make her issues seem all that important. This is a lightweight comedy about mostly likable people who are a bit too wrapped up in self-analysis.",Comedy
Please Give,"Three dimensional characters, direct no nonsense dialogue and a dry sense of humour combine to create an understated thoroughly enjoyable feel-good film that leaves viewers with an invisible glow.",Comedy
Please Give,Here's a sentence I've typed before: Rebecca Hall is the best thing about this movie. The British actress raises the level of every production she touches.,Comedy
Please Give,Director/writer Nicole Holofcener goes back east for Please Give. It is an auspicious move.,Comedy
Please Give,"Compare these wonderfully flawed, beautifully insecure and wholly believable characters with the preprogrammed mannequins seen in such chowderheaded efforts as, say, The Back-Up Plan or Killers, and the contrast is startling.",Comedy
Please Give,Real joys and sorrows must be bigger and deeper than this.,Comedy
Please Give,"It ends with this exchange: 'Thank You.' 'You're welcome.' How often do those simple words carry weight in a movie? At that moment, I loved those characters, and I loved this movie.",Comedy
Please Give,an Upper East Side slice of navel gazing,Comedy
Please Give,"Nicole Holofcener's lovely Please Give is a small, modest movie, full of the sort of characters we might know, or be.",Comedy
Please Give,"If you're hoping for huge dramatic payoff or more than mild laughs from cynically satisfying script, then you're panhandling without a Styrofoam cup.",Comedy
Please Give,This plot less movie lacks any momentum and you get no feeling of empathy or sympathy for any of the characters. The ensemble acting is sound with Guilbert standing out with a nostalgic trip down memory lane for viewers.,Comedy
Please Give,Ms. Holofcener's observant talky comedy resonates with plenty of oomph as a believable modern-day fable about urban life.,Comedy
Please Give,Nicole Holofcener creates open-ended characters whose ordinary lives are so fascinating that when the credits roll you're wondering why Transformers gets a sequel and not them.,Comedy
Please Give,"In both Please Give and Friends with Money, she wrestles with our all-to-human desire for nice things but judiciously avoids ridiculing her characters for sharing a longing that is as universal as it is regrettable.",Comedy
Please Give,"As Holofcener charts the telling little developments in these randomly connected lives the film offers wry smiles, smart repartee, mild whimsy and some plaintive, poignant moments.",Comedy
Please Give,"A spiky, sophisticated, grown-up comedy...",Comedy
Please Give,"Touching: that's what makes Holofcener's films so lovely. They are beady-eyed satires, sure, but they're also fundamentally kind-hearted.",Comedy
Please Give,"This is a small film, which, if you're open to it, will draw you into the lives of people you quickly forget are fictional.",Comedy
Please Give,"It sparks laughter by crossing the wires of human motivation, letting you see the hazards that exist in trying to be a good person.",Comedy
Please Give,"Writer-director Holofcener cleverly keeps the emotions gurgling right under the surface of this engaging interpersonal comedy. It's more about smiles than laughing out loud, but the superior cast members get terrific characters to play with.",Comedy
Please Give,"A well-written, well-acted dramatic comedy that is light on plot but generous in spirit.",Comedy
Please Give,"It is well-observed but morally stunted, in that it suggests that charity is just another form of self-medication",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener writes, and helps to shape on-screen, characters we often don't even like, and what do we do? We invite them home with us. Talk about a soft touch.",Comedy
Please Give,A stroll with these characters is a refreshing break from from the usual film exercises.,Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give is quintessential Holofcener -- a loopy, episodic ensemble story of women dealing with marriage, money and men, but it's also her smartest, most disciplined movie to date.",Comedy
Please Give,"Keener, one of the most reliably entertaining actresses currently working, specializes in sardonic, flawed characters -- a perfect fit for Holofcener's image of the modern American woman.",Comedy
Please Give,"Writer-director Nicole Holofcener seems to get better with every film, and now she's cruising along the well-trodden path of neurotic New Yorker comedy-drama with grace and comely confidence.",Comedy
Please Give,"Life-goes-on movies usually don't electrify the senses, but this one stimulates moral imagination.",Comedy
Please Give,"Keener has become Holofcener's artistic alter ego. In Please Give, the sharp-eyed filmmaker sends her vibrant representative out into the world to explore what it means for a woman to be lucky and still feel itchy.",Comedy
Please Give,"Nicole Holofcener, who writes the most interesting female characters in the movies, delivers another dazzling role to her muse, Catherine Keener, in Please Give, a delightfully dry dramedy about guilt.",Comedy
Please Give,"The acting quality is strong, especially from the ever-reliable Catherine Keener as Kate, but it's almost impossible to care about her character's dilemmas.",Comedy
Please Give,Wryly humane,Comedy
Please Give,"The film lives at that uneasy intersection between affluence and compassion, where the well-meaning well-to-do try to figure out how much of their wealth they need to give away to make a difference.",Comedy
Please Give,"It's involving and often gripping with wonderful performances by a top cast, although the sum of its parts is less than the story as a whole",Comedy
Please Give,"The main problem with the film, though, is that it seems to assume that self-obsessed and charmless people are automatically interesting - just for being people. There's definitely a flaw in that logic.",Comedy
Please Give,"Please Give isn't laugh-out-loud funny, it is witty and clever-a pleasing tale where not much happens, but spending time with the film's characters is enough.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener takes pretty much everything you're not supposed to talk about at a dinner party and spins it into a ruefully awkward, bone-dry comedy.",Comedy
Please Give,"The film is more emotionally incisive than it initially appears to be, but equally it ties together a little too neatly when it already has such a concise running time.",Comedy
Please Give,"Keener never lets us lose sight of something possibly redeemable about Kate, a move which ultimately saves her performance from lapsing into an easy social caricature.",Comedy
Please Give,Its conclusions are thoughtful and non-judgmental; satisfying even if it pulls a few punches.,Comedy
Please Give,"Doesn't have much plot, just characters interacting and developing, and its lack of a need for drama is refreshing.",Comedy
Please Give,"You have to be smart and funny and really aware of yourself to write and direct a film like this, which is exactly what director Nicole Holofcener is.",Comedy
Please Give,"Funny at times, Please Give is a surprisingly heartwarming coming-of-age film for six adults all passing through different stages of heir life.",Comedy
Please Give,"In another director's hands, this subject might have been rife with sanctimony. Instead, Holofcener has made a sly, urbane comedy with several smart actresses who make her acerbic dialogue lively and believable, character-driven.",Comedy
Please Give,"In writer/director Nicole Holofcener's crisp, poignant and funny new movie, Kipling's ""white man's burden"" has evolved into the liberal woman's guilt.",Comedy
Please Give,"The most underrated American director this side of Richard Linklater, Nicole Holofcener, continues to be a master of The Moment: a tiny but meaningful exchange or look or gesture that conveys more emotion than any awards-bait monologue could.",Comedy
Please Give,"Holofcener brings a knowing empathy to all her characters, even the cruel cosmetician played by Peet. But she seems to have found a screen surrogate in Keener...",Comedy
Please Give,Please Give is truly a film for our age; it's darkly comic stuff from a mistress of the miserable-urbanites genre.,Comedy
Please Give,"About the people who give, the people who don't give and how we finally manage to connect with one another.",Comedy

3:10 to Yuma,It's rather talky but always remains lively and tense.,"Classics, Drama, Western"
3:10 to Yuma,A taut Western (obviously inspired by High Noon) about a lone man bravely standing on principle when all others have abandoned him. Marred only by a phony ending.,"Classics, Drama, Western"
3:10 to Yuma,"It's of necessity a talkative film, with Ford working on Heflin's nerves in a stream of Machiavellian banter, but one held in perfect balance by Daves, who keeps the tension strung taut.","Classics, Drama, Western"
3:10 to Yuma,This is a first-rate action picture -- a respectable second section to High Noon.,"Classics, Drama, Western"

Abraham Lincoln,"Brilliant flashes of direction permeate the entire film, and it remains distinctively a product of the great master.","Classics, Drama"
Abraham Lincoln,"D. W. Griffith's first sound film, from 1930, is as ungainly and majestic as its subject.","Classics, Drama"
Abraham Lincoln,"It feels mostly like an antique, but even antiques have their own particular beauties.","Classics, Drama"
Abraham Lincoln,"Feels like a relic, a sad, weak swan song from one of cinema's most legendary filmmakers.","Classics, Drama"
Abraham Lincoln,"The fact that it draws tears is rather against it than for it. The pathos of a tremendous social occurrence should not be refined or lachrymose, but revealing. The social occurrence seldom gets a chance here.","Classics, Drama"
Dark Water,"...while Dark Water isn't a complete wash (no pun intended), watched side-by-side with Ringu, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,The picture is melancholy remembrance and its sources of fear are intimate and brilliant.,"Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"A horror movie that sits there and drags and seems very full of itself, and is based on the premise that puddles are scary. They're not.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"just beneath its surface horror this film conceals a deep reservoir of tragedy, addressing themes like family breakdown, isolation, abandonment, and - something of a taboo in Japan - the terrible legacy of mental illness.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"With extremely heavy echoes of his own 1998 film Ringu, Nakata is on subtle creep-out form here rather than big horror movie mode.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"To date, the scariest movie I've ever seen.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"Um terror bem construdo que no quer apenas provocar sustos passageiros, mas sim estabelecer um clima de tenso constante e personagens com os quais realmente nos importemos.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"

Dark Water,About as frightening as a soggy diaper.,"Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,"It's flawed, but you should see Dark Water, a decent little chiller that brings a whole new meaning to rising damp.","Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
Dark Water,Its cleverness relies on transferring our concern from the supernatural events emanating from one lost child to the natural fear of a mother losing her own child to the other world.,"Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Accused,The Accused demonstrates that rape victims often are suspects in their own cases.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Accused,"In her first Oscar role, Jodie Foster's gang-raped waitress transforms from a good-time hard-drinking girl to a woman fighting for the self-esteem she never had.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Accused,"Possibly the best performance Foster has even given, and the best of its type","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Accused,"This performance didn't just win an Oscar. It won the hearts of every woman who has ever had to endure the horror of assault and the continued injustice of having to fight against prejudice and a legal system steeped in patriarchy, to be heard.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Accused,"Kelly McGillis can make little of her underwritten role; economy is commend-able, but a woman in all her complexity cannot be represented by a pair of outsize shoulder-pads.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Accused,"It compares very favorably with movies like The Good Mother, in which bad girls/sexual women make their bed, of nails, and are then told they better bloody well lie in it.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Lost City,"Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for.",Drama
The Lost City,"Somewhere inside this overlong, sometimes engaging, often tedious affair, there may be a solid, 100-minute movie.",Drama
The Lost City,Garcia's overindulgence is punishing but I didn't come to the theatre to be soaked in soap opera sentiment.,Drama
The Lost City,"Garcia offers the film to the Cuban community as something we should all be happy to see, but his esteem does not excuse the film's aesthetic mediocrity, cultural ignorance, and colossal self-absorption.",Drama
The Lost City,"Staged with credibility and loads of Cubano flair, the film slows to a sludgy crawl, giving us lots of time to consider it as a pro-old-guard, anti- revolutionary elegy.",Drama
The Lost City,Andy Garcia takes his time showing putting a plague on both the houses of Batista and Castro.,Drama
The Lost City,"... it's too long, politically confusing and painfully self-indulgent, loaded with too many tertiary characters and darting from one subplot to the next like a butterfly with hiccups.",Drama
The Lost City,"Compelling in fits and starts, actor-director Andy Garcia's The Lost City possesses grand aspirations but troublesome execution.",Drama
The Lost City,"A lot goes wrong in this overlong movie, but it has a human touch.",Drama
The Lost City,"...even trying to put [politics] aside, The Lost City has a number of problems.",Drama
The Lost City,"Garcia's aching nostalgia for the glittering Havana of his dreams is palpable, but he winds up painting by the same 'doomed romance against a backdrop of revolution' numbers as piffle like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights.",Drama
The Lost City,... a lost movie that seems like it takes 16 years to end.,Drama
The Lost City,"How the movie's politics will sit with the audience aside, one of the problems in this overlong melodrama is the distracting casting of Bill Murray as a wisecracking sidekick and Dustin Hoffman as mobster Meyer Lansky.",Drama
The Lost City,"The sprawling -- two hours, 23 minutes -- epic meanders in places and its mix of tones and templates do not always serve its narrative. But the movie comes from the heart, filled with a passion that carries it through its rougher patches.",Drama
The Lost City,"Havana may remain, in many ways, a lost city, but it'll take more than this movie to find it.",Drama
The Lost City,... the film seems like a mini-series edited to feature length without time for character development.,Drama
The Lost City,"The Lost City manages to make Havana, Sydney Pollack's disastrous 1990 attempt at a Casablanca homage set against the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford, look good by comparison.",Drama
The Lost City,... a haphazard jumble.,Drama
The Lost City,"Noteworthy and well-intended, The Lost City isn't exactly a lost opportunity, just a sincerely limited one.",Drama
The Lost City,... a romantic epic manque that swoons across the screen for nearly two and a half hours without saying much ...,Drama
The Lost City,"Garcia, who fled the country with his family as a young boy, obviously has a fierce passion for this material, and he knows to his very soul.",Drama
The Lost City,"As a director, Garcia is such a sucker for gratuitous crosscutting and glossily elliptical filmmaking that viewers can be forgiven for mistaking Lost City for a 143-minute montage sequence.",Drama
The Lost City,This is a very sad and winsome film.,Drama
The Lost City,Handsomely executed but hopelessly flawed.,Drama
The Lost City,"Throbbing with music, seething with anger and romance, The Lost City is a film that breaks your heart, bewilders, alienates and ravishes you by turns.",Drama
The Lost City,"The Lost City has a subject, a setting and a historical backdrop, but in the foreground it has a relatively passive protagonist, Fico, whose passions are understated and whose fortunes inspire only minor concern.",Drama
The Lost City,"Overdirected, yes, but it's an epic, passionate portrayal.",Drama
The Lost City,"Feels like the distillation of countless conversations and family legends, rehearsed from time immemorial by Cubans who fled their homeland and sought to re-create it in their memories.",Drama
The Lost City,It's the sort of epic that aspires to tell Cuba's modern political history and celebrate its people without introducing us to a single believable character.,Drama
The Lost City,"Musical...handsome...poignantly nostalgic...The Lost City is a lot of things, but what it's not is incisive.",Drama
The Lost City,"... full of characters with import more symbolic than dramatic (Bill Murray plays a veritable court jester), ideas that wander and contradictions that dissipate.",Drama
The Lost City,"A tribute to pre-revolutionary Havana, an elegy on what was lost, a little payback for a regime that drove his family out and, best of all, a synthesis of the driving Afro-Cuban rhythms of the extraordinary music.",Drama
The Lost City,"You can see why Garcia was drawn to this material, but he hasn't had much luck shaping it into a film.",Drama
The Lost City,"As a musical fever dream of paradise lost, The Lost City is a flawed success, boasting just enough truth and admirable purpose to justify the hazards of Garcia's passion.",Drama
The Lost City,"The film suggests a dutiful if clunky pastiche of The Godfather and a right-wing Reds, with Fellove and his brothers and parents representing a spectrum of possible responses to the Cuban revolution.",Drama
The Lost City,"Though the filmmaker's feel for his Cuban heritage is bone-deep, it's a glazed and dolorous movie -- a depressed epic.",Drama
The Lost City,"Lovely to look at, and its mixture of Cuban standards and Garcia originals is delightful to listen to.",Drama
The Lost City,"The coming CD, not the DVD, should be the keeper.",Drama
The Lost City,"Somewhere amid the bric-a-brac -- hot rhythms, ocean breezes and political upheaval and melodrama -- a movie languishes. Garcia never really finds it.",Drama
The Lost City,"A pretty bauble, a trinket offered when the stakes of barter were life and death.",Drama
The Lost City,"What makes this movie interesting is the family (and not just because it's made up of 3 beautiful brothers). It's a love story, between a man and a woman and between a people and their country.",Drama
The Lost City,"While earnest in intent and visually elegant, simply too narratively amorphous and emotionally desiccated.",Drama
The Lost City,"If you want to see a good, entertaining movie about Havana, circa 1958, better to rent Havana, than waste your money on this turkey.",Drama
The Lost City,Listening to the soundtrack would likely provide a better artistic experience than watching this predictable plot play out.,Drama
The Lost City,Garcia's fans and viewers who love Cuban music will probably enjoy The Lost City if they don't mind the long run time.,Drama
The Lost City,"For a film rooted in the director's own experience, The Lost City is surprisingly unilluminating.",Drama
The Lost City,"Our cue that Garcia is acting is when he furiously bats his eyes in his smoldering emotional scenes. Either that, or he's allergic to the smoke from all those Cuban cigars.",Drama
The Lost City,"It's barely coherent as it is, but at 2 hours and 23 minutes, The Lost City is simply infuriating.",Drama
The Lost City,"Too scattered, too confused, too patched-together to work dramatically.",Drama
The Lost City,The movie has too many stories to tell and tells none of them very well.,Drama
The Lost City,"Unfortunately, the broad scope leads to a tedious pace, as Garcia lacks the restraint to match his keen visual eye.",Drama
The Lost City,"Turgid, lumpy and almost unwatchably dull.",Drama
The Lost City,"It's a potent work, enlivened by fabulous Cuban music and Garcia's obvious love for his land and his culture.",Drama
The Lost City,"Unfortunately, Garcia is inept as a director. His scenes are shapeless and bloated with self-important speeches.",Drama
The Lost City,Unsteady but often entrancing.,Drama
The Lost City,"Somehow simultaneously too much and not enough. At 143 minutes, it well overstays its welcome as a movie, but with a little more fleshing out it might have worked as a miniseries.",Drama
The Lost City,"It's handsome and heartfelt but mired in murky politics, plot inertia, musical montages and painfully pointed symbolism.",Drama
The Lost City,Garcia needed better guiding hands and eyes in the editing room to jettison the many parts that bog down the story.,Drama
The Lost City,"... when it finds its footing, it becomes the movie it longs to be. And that happens often enough to make it worth finding, even when it seems as lost as the city it loves.",Drama
The Lost City,"Even though the movie is made with an abundance of heart, it's sad to report that the final result has only a weak pulse.",Drama
The Lost City,"Book-ended by fine songs; in between, Garcia offers more than two hours of clumsy Coppola/Scorsese karaoke...",Drama
The Lost City,"For a tribute to a lost city, Garcia has made a lost film.",Drama
The Lost City,"The result has a potluck rather than persuasive, integrated quality.",Drama
The Lost City,"Shapeless stories that drift away from the revolution, puffed up by a biased take on 1959 Cuba with the hot air of romance.",Drama
The Lost City,Garcia's storytelling lacks highs and lows and has far too much going on. And on.,Drama
The Lost City,"While the soundtrack of Cuban dance music is superb, this historical drama is leaden and simply too long-winded for its own good.",Drama
The Lost City,"...plays like a confusing and inferior Caribbean analog to The Godfather, without anything like the narrative drive of Coppola's film.",Drama
The Lost City,"When it succeeds, the film conveys a bittersweet longing for a lost moment and the unfulfilled promise of a democratic Cuba.",Drama
The Lost City,"It's by no means a flawless film, but it's a meaty one, and if you're a big fan of Andy Garcia, I'd definitely recommend it. (Plus, Bill Murray's in there.)",Drama
The Lost City,Garcia is just too earnest to make his dream project anything but deadly dull.,Drama
The Lost City,Garcia obviously has more ambition than skill.,Drama
The Lost City,"Andy Garcia's directorial debut is a flawed and overlong but nonetheless watchable drama with strong performances, a superb soundtrack and bizarre appearances from Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray.",Drama
The Lost City,"'The Lost City' is intriguing as a historical document and adequate as cinema, but it has a blandness at its core that no amount of spicy mambo and booty-quaking dance routines can disguise.",Drama
The Lost City,"There may be a good film here, but it struggles to break free of the cumbersome framework.",Drama
The Lost City,"Andy Garcia's preposterous vanity project The Lost City is an all-singing, all-dancing version of the Cuban Revolution.",Drama
The Lost City,"The script is scrupulously even-handed, but Garcia can't seem to get a grip on this sprawl.",Drama
The Lost City,"Great music and costumes, but with a woeful plot and jaw-droppingly stilted dialogue. Cuban-born Garcia's main complaint against Fidel seems to be that rich, corrupt Cubans could no longer dance the night away.",Drama
The Lost City,"Not an embarrassment, but definitely a missed opportunity.",Drama
The Lost City,Unfolds like a series of as outtakes from Hollywood productions,Drama
The Lost City,By the half way point I was beginning to take back everything I said re Steven Soderbergh's dull-as-ditchwater Che: Part II - even he manages to drum up more tension than this.,Drama
The Breaking Point,Clearly the best movie adaptation of a Hemingway novel.,Drama
The Breaking Point,"The Breaking Point adapts Hemingway's book and wrings out some genuine notes of solid tragedy, as well as a more nuanced performance from its lead actor.",Drama
The Breaking Point,The insistence and courage of the film's final shot elevates it from a very good film to a nearly great one.,Drama
The Breaking Point,"Harry may be tough, but in Curtiz' hands he's basically a nice guy in noirland.",Drama
The Breaking Point,"The film is always interesting and often exciting, and Mr. Michael Curtiz has directed it in a tough and sullen style which is most effective.",Drama
The Breaking Point,The Breaking Point is crackling good drama.,Drama
The Breaking Point,"It emerges as a strong, sardonic melodrama, more honest than most in its close-ups of human relationships.",Drama
The Breaking Point,"Phyllis Thaxter steals the show. Her scenes are the best in the movie, and some of the best domestic scenes in cinema history. You don't often see a husband and wife on equal footing like this, nor do you see it this sexually charged.",Drama
The Breaking Point,"The acting, script and direction (by Michael Curtiz) are first-rate, making it classic filmmaking.",Drama
The Breaking Point,"Arguably the superior mounting of the Ernest Hemingway story, The Breaking Point proves moral gloom exists as equally and virulently sunny-side up.",Drama

Criminal,"Produced by Soderbergh, Criminal bears an uncanny resemblance to the master's films.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Criminal's biggest offense may be that Jacobs and his actors make absolutely no attempt to rewrite Nine Queens.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,[Full of] fine acting and sharp dialog.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"By the end, those who haven't seen Nine Queens may applaud the entertaining sleight-of-hand...those who have may lament that Criminal is the proverbial old dog.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The result isn't as compelling as Nine Queens, but it's a respectable caper movie in the tradition of The Sting and David Mamet's Heist.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"[D]amn if Criminal doesn't actually improve upon The Nine Queens, the Argentine film upon which it is very closely based.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,A classic crime caper that twists and turns with an easy subtly.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Criminal,"a quirky daylight noir with a plot that spins on a dime as its twists and turns on its way to proving that it's greed, not love, that doth make fools of us all","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"We know someone is pulling something, and someone is going to get away with something, and someone is going to be left holding the bag of cheese, but Jacobs keeps us on our toes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Manages to satisfy despite being inferior to the original on nearly every level.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,John C. Reilly stars as a gimlet-eyed con man in this clever and diverting adaptation of the Argentine thriller Nine Queens.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Inherently calculated and cold, so smugly satisfied with itself and its surprise final trick that it seems to be running its own con to convince us the script's house of cards is actually substantial, original and slick.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,A reminder of the genre's irresistible lure and what pleasures can be derived when it cares enough to do things right.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"A light, speedy movie, as agreeably modest as a pop hit or a BLT.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Habitual duplicity and backstabbing create a stimulating, deceptively intricate plot maze in this sharp, shrewd, but not showy remake.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's all done with sufficient style that, when we get there, the end no longer feels like the point.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The finest tribute I can lavish on this stateside remake of 2002's Argentinean export Nine Queens is that it took me a full hour to remember I had seen the original -- and reviewed it, no less.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Criminal does what every good con-game movie should: It keeps you guessing.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Criminal is the sort of movie David Mamet would love -- or make.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"This remake of the Argentine hit is effective at times, and Gyllenhaal shows a new side of her talent, but the main impression is of first-rate performers doing second-rate work.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's hip, witty and fun, and will remind you why movies are made in the first place.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,It's an auspicious debut for first-timer Gregory Jacobs.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Fans of con-man capers will have no regrets after watching Criminal.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Jacobs doesn't add anything new to the genre, but his version of taking the concepts out for a walk is entertaining enough to mark time until Ocean's Twelve.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Caper-movie lightning in a bottle, Criminal grifts the audience in a spectacular way.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"A strong cast and some nice surprises, but misses the sparkle of the original.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Although Criminal retains its source material's cleverness and intricate plotting, something seems to have been lost in the translation.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The performances are winning -- Gyllenhaal is particularly sharp as an aggrieved sibling, and there's mutual zing in her scenes with Reilly.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,An exercise where viewers are likely to ponder not 'How did the characters do it?' but 'Who cares?',"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"May not be any great shakes as a cinematic puzzle, but it gives Reilly and Luna an opportunity to perform a thespian song-and-dance routine.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Cast against type, Reilly unequivocally demonstrates the range, versatility, and ability that made him such a hot prospect over the last decade.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"...newbies looking for an easy-breezy Ocean's Eleven-and-a-Half should get a kick out of this frugally low-key, innocuous cover song of a caper.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It is near impossible to make a great movie about con artists, because of the very nature of the genre itself.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Reilly and Luna make a chemically appealing screen team.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Jacobs -- who for many years was Soderbergh's assistant director -- keeps things moving at a sprightly pace, and cinematographer Chris Menges does a terrific job of capturing L.A. in all its mercurial glory.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,This is a chance for Reilly to strut his stuff -- so good he ought to be illegal -- in harmony or against the grain with a variety of terrific character actors.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The remake is infinitely more entertaining if you haven't seen Nine Queens -- the details are different, but the surprises are the same and something of the first film's underlying darkness has been lost in translation.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Maybe watching Reilly, Luna and Gyllenhaal is quite enough entertainment value for any movie.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,The problems lie not with the actors but with a glib approach that exposes the flaws of the original story.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The fast, forced plot, which moves up from street grifts to a big score involving rare currency, lives in the amusing and zippered byplay of Luna and Reilly, who achieve a sort of marriage du jour for criminal purposes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's a good film, suitably entertaining, but there's the nagging question of why everyone bothered.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"In the end, coincidence undoes Criminal.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Those unfamiliar with Fabian Bielinsky's 2002 film will delight to this delicious deviousness.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"The constant shadow of doubt keeps the viewer from investing in the characters, because we suspect one or more of them isn't what they seem.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"L.A. looks hip in its lemonade light, and the low-budget Ocean's Eleven attitude gives Criminal a certain down-and-out swing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It instantly earns a place alongside Jim McBride's pointless American take on Godard's Breathless on Hollywood's long, long shelf of misguided remakes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Entertaining and well acted, but redundant and a bit machinelike.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"In a way, the whole movie is a con job -- offering an inferior copy of something that wasn't too wonderful to begin with, while pretending that it has something new and stylish to sell.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Doesn't exactly reinvigorate an overworked genre, but neither does it disgrace the format or the original movie.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,A breathless and dazzling caper that knocks your socks off.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's such a pleasure being in the company of these actors as they work with character-rich material that if they burst into the audience and swindled us out of our wallets, we would gladly oblige.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's a listless, dutiful affair -- a cover version played out of obligation, not inspiration.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Its spiral of deceptions within deceptions remains resolutely character-based until the outlandish end, which proves emotionally satisfying because it's based on what really drives people as much as too-clever plotting.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,An incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Reilly plays it so dour and unappealing, and Gyllenhaal comes off like such a sourpuss it's hard to garner a rooting interest one way or another.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,The disparity between Richard and Rodrigo is too great and the impossible coincidences of the ending are too far-fetched.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,This is the kind of movie so full of coincidence and double crosses that you simply don't have the mental energy to go back and sort it all out at the end.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Some snappy dialogue, fine performances and lots of shady atmosphere give Criminal a tasty B-movie flavor.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"What elevates Criminal into a delicious con in the league of Red Rock West, House of Games or Matchstick Men is John C. Reilly.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Follows the original fairly closely, and because I already knew the plot secrets, it couldn't work on me in its intended way. As the recycled characters, dialog and events turned up, there seemed to be an echo in the room.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Glances at family dynamics and class divisions benefit the genre mix, and the cast animates the lean script with a simmering brew of charm, smarm, ferocious greed and street smarts.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Reilly sheds a career playing dupes and schlubs and gives his first full-tilt electric performance.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Scores higher than most con artist movies by focusing more on the artists than the con.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Criminal has a wonderful modern film noir feel punctuated with incredibly clever dialog...,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,It has half the panache and none of the surprise for anyone who saw the original.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It's funny, fast-paced, and sharp - as entertaining in English as it was in Spanish.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,I have to give Nine Hearts the edge but Criminal is an honest remake of its source material.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Discerning audiences won't be scammed with this one.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,This double-whammy re-make will keep you guessing until the end.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Jacobs has brought the barrio into noir, and that's no small achievement. If nothing else, it opens the door to a whole new galaxy of grift.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,This remake of 'Nine Queens' is just as absorbing for those who did not see the original.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,... unfolds like a David Mamet film ...,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,The Argentinean film Nine Queens re-dealt in a by-the-numbers American version set in Los Angeles.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Criminal can be praised and damned for its fidelity to the Argentinean masterpiece Nine Queens.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"If subtitles are not your thing and you're in the mood to witness an elegant con job in the classic Mamet mold, then Criminal is the card to play.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"A competent Americanization of the Argentinian film ""Nine Queens,"" with John C. Reilly seemingly enjoying his atypical leading role.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"even when the emotional aspect of the story starts to work, it is ultimately undermined by a final twist","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Not smooth or seductive enough to coerce you into taking it at face value.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Like dj vu all over again.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Maybe I'm dense, but the finale of Criminal left me not exactly sure what was won and what was lost or why I should care.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"With dashes of black humour and pointed glimpses of the American class system, Criminal is a taut con-versus-con game whose deft artistry isn't fully revealed until the last few minutes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"A kind of who-done-what? puzzle. You'll probably enjoy it much more if you haven't seen the 2002 Argentine film, Nine Queens.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"You can't go too far wrong on the performance front with John C. Reilly, Diego Luna or Maggie Gyllenhaal, but this one never really goes above average.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Itself something of a counterfeit, 'Criminal' loses coherence at each new plot twist, eventually becoming silly and contrived.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Yet another inexplicable American remake that adds nothing new to the original.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,The remake is so faithful to the first film that some of the snap and crackle disappears if you know the plot. It's like watching The Sixth Sense for a second time.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"A jazzy, offhandedly brilliant exercise in colorful mendacity and shell game shenanigans that benefits from the cool, authoritative occupational swagger of John C. Reilly.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,This is one of the best con movies I have seen as rare currency is used as the valuable commodity.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Like a smash-and-grab job, the movie gets in, springs the con and gets out quick - leaving the viewer to replay the twists on his or her own time.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"While the twists at the end are a little more predictable here than in the first film, it's still an assured work, especially considering that it comes from a first-time director.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Redundant.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"It isn't quite as witty or gritty as Nine Queens, but if you didn't see that film, then see it now that it's in English.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Well acted and intriguing...,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Reilly is perhaps the most amazing fusion of boy and man we have in American movies.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,... a fairly straightforward remake of the Argentine hit Nine Queens (2000),"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Considerando-se que o timo Nove Rainhas foi realizado h apenas alguns anos, esta refilmagem soa desnecessria, por mais interessante que seja seu roteiro.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"it's Training Day for confidence tricksters, an exciting 24-hour tour of LA's underworld with a headache-inducing sting in its tail.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Criminal,A second-generation photocopy of a David Mamet cryptogram.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,"Con film aficionados won't find the picture revolutionary, but even they should enjoy the structure, craftsmanship and a nice supporting performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Criminal,Those viewers who watched NUEVE REINAS beforehand will be affected with increasingly unpleasant feeling of deja vu.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Tristan & Isolde,This Tristan is strictly for those who prefer their romantic melodrama bloodied up a bit.,"Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,"Unlike the opera, this version of the tale features no mystical elements and comes off as horribly contrived. What's more, director Kevin Reynolds' sluggish pacing makes the film feels twice as long as it really is.","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,Franco looks appropriately troubled as Tristan. Myles is pretty and sweet enough to win hearts as Isolde.,"Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"

Tristan & Isolde,Stolen moments from other films abound but director Kevin Reynolds has clearly given the story and characters a life and identity of their own.,"Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"

Tristan & Isolde,"A poignant, old-fashioned, history-heavy forbidden romance","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,"The legend of ""Tristan & Isolde"" happened a long time ago, so the story goes. And here it's retold as an average film that could have been worse, but could have been better, for the resume of director Kevin Reynolds.","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,It's so cheesy and corny.,"Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"

Tristan & Isolde,"Unlike Franco's mop, no amount of teasing can keep this romance from falling flat.","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,"By removing the sorcery and operatic excess so synonymous with the story, the filmmakers conjure an affecting, pretty melodrama... with the emphasis more on mellow than drama.","Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"
Tristan & Isolde,A strong visual style and a violent streak only partially undone by the PG-13 rating.,"Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Romance"

Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film.

Oliver Twist,"The first question I have is, why? Why would Roman Polanski, one of the most innovative directors of the last half-century, want to adapt a story that has been told again and again?","Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"Fails to topple Lean's untoppable version; still one of the best movies of 2005. Startlingly unemotional, but for the stormy torments behind Fagin's overhanging eyebrows.","Drama, Kids & Family"

Oliver Twist,[T]he maddening thing is not just that we hardly need another movie adaptation of [Oliver Twist] ... but that there are other Dickens books that haven't been given the major movie treatment that would better suit Polanski's temperament.,"Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"A severely overlooked, exceedingly well-done version of an oft-told tale...One of the best films of 2005.","Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,It just might supplant David Lean's 1948 version as the one that students turn to for a 2-hour study guide.,"Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"The movie understands what Polanski himself knew upon surviving the Holocaust--you take your kindness where you can find it, weighing its price along the way.","Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"With intelligence and style (inspired by the art of Gustave Dor and Francisco Sol), Polanski makes a rewarding contribution to Dickens' legacy on screen.","Drama, Kids & Family"

Oliver Twist,Oliver Twist is an affecting and refreshing adaptation of Dickens seminal work from a master director.,"Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"A smorgasbord of urban decay, social disorder, and class conflict imbues the film with a potent sensuality","Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,Certainly Polanski deserves our gratitude for obliging the cast not to sink their teeth too deep into Dickens' juicy dialogue.,"Drama, Kids & Family"
Oliver Twist,"Polanski and Harwood have streamlined the meandering narrative to Dickens' second novel, which may horrify purists, but which works well enough for the filmmakers' purposes.","Drama, Kids & Family"

All of Me,Steve Martin's brilliant physical comedy is only the highlight of this satisfying little giggle-fest.,"Comedy, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
All of Me,"A decent diversion, but a largely forgettable film. Martin and Tomlin try hard, but don't get as many laughs as they should.","Comedy, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Amazing Grace,A terrific subject becomes a tepid morality play.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Fernando Meirelles and Edward Zwick take note: Amazing Grace is proof that liberal filmmakers can make movies that aren't desperate manifestations of their political guilt.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Based on the true story of one man's crusade to end slavery in 18th-century Great Britain, Michael Apted's film is a conventional social injustice drama, immenseley helped by Iown Gruffudd's captivating lead performance.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"This compelling bio-pic is an overdue tribute to William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the British abolitionist who, for 20 years, tirelessly lobbied Parliament to end England's participation in the slave trade.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace, from a screenplay by Steven Knight, turns out to be blessed with inspirational nobility and comic eccentricity to bring it to emotional fruition.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"TV in vision, structure and execution. To think feature film as a delivery vehicle for it is more ambitious than this telling of a worthy, under-appreciated story justifies.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,An inspiring drama directed by Michael Apted about a zealous abolitionist in eighteenth century England who models for us a moral heroism.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Sanitized version of the career and life of William Wilberforce, who thought that the uncouth behavior of slaves was a greater sin than slavery itself. Pure hagiography and an assault on the historical record.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Michael Apted's Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No, it's not subtle, but how subtle was slavery?","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Inspiring drama of how one man can make a huge difference in the fight against the importation of slaves in Britain.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Though it's not as inspiring as its makers might have wished, it's a solid, respectful treatment of a significant episode in the anti-slavery movement.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"an intelligent film about serious thinkers and their ideas, and it's director Michael Apted's spare, incisive vison that prevents the film from becoming either cloying or maudlin, though the screen is painted with emotion","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,It leaves the blood unstirred.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Apted is without a doubt one of the foremost documentarians working today. His Up Series represents a cinematic hallmark. His feature credits are less certain.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Amazing Grace,Amazing Grace is a case of good works done well...[an] admirable historical drama.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A movie for people who like uncomplicated, uplifting stories where good triumphs over evil.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"[Apted's] picture, openhearted and enthusiastic, is partly an ode to Wilberforce and partly a love letter to the simple act of taking action.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace is an important historical drama that comes out at a good time for movie-goers who want high quality, thought provoking entertainment.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Those who take the plunge will be rewarded with an unusually satisfying and inspiring historical epic from one of contemporary cinema's best filmmakers.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Like Steven Spielberg's glossy Amistad before it, Amazing Grace shies away from the texture and complexity of color, scurrying instead for the safer platitudes of black and white -- good and evil.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy. [He] has managed to be true to the outsized emotions of the story without giving way to sentimentality.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"[Director Michael Apted] has an unfortunate penchant for bland stateliness, and never more so than in Amazing Grace.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace arrives Hollywood-slick, a polished British period piece. It manipulates, but then again, so does the song that gives it its title. Movies, like hymns and history, should give us a good cry.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"It's clear that the filmmakers believe a movie about political debate has to have a lot of speechifying. Consequently, it's so talky that it gradually loses our interest, which is a real shame.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Earnest, respectful and thoroughly dull, Michael Apted's Amazing Grace follows all of the worst traditions of British historical dramas.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,What makes William Wilberforce a great man is also what makes him a bore: He's possessed of such intractable single-mindedness and confidence in the rightness of his ideals that we can't help but wish he would lay aside saving the world for a while.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"It's a good story, but director Michael Apted can't help but fall into the usual cinematic habits of the hagiographic species.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Steven Knight's ponderous script is front-loaded with expository deep background and stuffed into an awkward structure that lumbers back and forth between Wilberforce the early idealist and Wilberforce the broken man.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"As written by Steven Knight, it seems so taken with Wilberforce's moral magnificence, it forgets to involve the audience, too.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"How could Michael Apted, who directed those towering pillars of truth the 7 Up documentaries, make a movie as bogus as Amazing Grace?","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Well-made by Michael Apted, and well-acted all around.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,That rare bird: a tear-jerker about the House of Commons and the antislavery movement in England. Michael Apted's idolatrous portrait of abolitionist William Wilberforce is wall-to-wall with intriguing characters and deeply felt performances.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The rhythms [director Michael Apted and editor Rick Shaine] establish are jumpy and unsteady, afraid of allowing a scene to breathe and flow naturally. If the script were more alive, these matters of visual technique would matter less. But not much less.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"If you seek a movie that is uplifting, enlightening and ennobling, then Grace is for you.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"History purists will find the details enchanting, period drama fanatics will adore the arm's-length posture of the piece, and the true-life tale is one worth being told. Just make sure to ingest loads of caffeine before watching.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Amazing Grace,Coming soon to a social studies class near you.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Steven Knight has enlivened what might have been workmanlike, spiced the romance with wit, spiked the period-piece punch with pizzazz.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace, a prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce, carries a strong whiff of piety. It isn't a bad smell; there are notes of roses and treacle in the mix, but also elements of sweat and pain.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Gruffudd and Apted are pleasantly earnest in their efforts to spread Wilberforce's message of peace and justice.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"[The screenwriter] does an admirable job of streamlining a story that unfolds over the course of 20 years. Meanwhile, Apted allows his fine cast the breathing room to make historical figures feel like living, breathing people rather than waxworks.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A detailed, affecting biography of one of the great souls who moved humanity forward.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Often vulnerable, more often inspiring, Gruffudd's Wilberforce not only stirs curiosity but also quickens your conscience. As Fox notes eloquently, he was a great man. One does not have to be religious to believe he had amazing grace.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Don't shy away for fear of a dry bit of educational cinema; Amazing Grace is a well-told and very human story.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Characters are so imprisoned by the movie's need to drive home its antislavery message that they become utterly lifeless. Pretty pictures abound in Amazing Grace, but they don't serve to illustrate any ideas or emotions worth wrestling with.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"[Director] Apted gives the movie a reasonably good period feel. Working with an obviously limited budget, it feels like something you might see on the History Channel, but that's not necessarily a knock.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace isn't quite an accurate title for this entertaining history lesson, but no one will ever write a song titled 'Amazing 20-Year Period of Parliamentary Maneuvering to End Britain's Role in the Slave Trade.'","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Michael Apted's compelling and highly informative Amazing Grace is an apt celebration of America's Black History Month, even though its story takes place in England.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,The film ultimately tells a powerful and little-known historical tale.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Director Michael Apted and screenwriter Steven Knight can't help letting a little sanctification take hold -- while also, sadly, making a charged historical subject seem tedious.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Director Michael Apted tells the story with dry devotion to parliamentary procedurals and a worshipful approach to Wilberforce. But [actor] Gruffudd lacks the intensity and charisma to pull it off.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace is the stuff of great lessons and inspiration and hope, and if it's all delivered with a bit too much moral push, well, moral push apparently was what William Wilberforce was all about. There's another word for such dweebs: Heroes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Director Michael Apted has turned out a movie that might be best described as faithful, both in its attention to accuracy and in its acknowledgement of the role faith played in righting one of the great social wrongs.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"In building his movie around a single issue, Apted succeeds in capturing a rough-and-tumble side to politics that never feels too far removed from our own day.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"I'm sure [director] Apted meant well, but Amazing Grace comes across as a surprisingly graceless biopic narrowed down to one white man's uncomfortable burden.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The film is inspiring. When Wilberforce finally achieves victory, Lord Fox makes a speech, in which the opening words, sadly, still ring true today: 'When people think of great men, rarely do they think of peaceful men.'","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Screenwriter Steven Knight gracefully articulates the many domestic and international forces at work.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The movie is the usual kind of film biography of a respected figure from the distant past -- honorable, oversimplified, handsome.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"An inspirational, moving and wonderfully well-told story that comes to the screen at just the right time.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace may not accomplish the depth of poignancy inherent in its subject, but it's a steady effort.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Although the film does skirt the edge of preachiness at times, you certainly can't argue with the basic human decency that it's preaching.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The rhetoric in the film is clearly intended to be relevant to the situation in the United States today... 'Our fear of an unknown enemy must not be allowed to erode our long-cherished liberties,' says a Wilberforce ally.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,A well-told cinematic example of a man who used his faith and God-given opportunities to change the world for good.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"There is a cheering sense of moral force behind this film, which could have become preachy, trite and clotted with self-righteousness.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The focus on Wilberforce's ailing body seems a peculiar, not to say ""amazing,"" displacement of affliction.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A good film editor could have made this 111-minute effort into an entertaining, tight 90 minute film, without losing any of the story or suspense.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"[Screenwriter] Knight should be remembered at year's end for not only telling a compelling story, but for delightfully smart and witty dialogue that never feels unnatural in the actors' mouths.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Handsome bio-pic wavers between a sur+ of piety and a well done history lesson.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Blending period drama with message-driven political wrangling, Amazing Grace is as earnest and well-intentioned as it is unsurprising.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Chimes in for freedom, but rarely hits the high notes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,...ponderous and relentlessly padded in its moral morass... Grace manages to work effectively as a crusading costume drama drenched in consciousness and conviction.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"As square as this movie is, it has been made with eloquence and jaunty high spirits, and it tells a good story that is virtually unknown here.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Climax is a groundswell of tear-inducing virtue that ultimately leaves Grace on a high, if not amazing, note.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Think of this as ""Pride and Prejudice"" meets ""Reds"".","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"One of the nobler 'based on true events' efforts I've seen in some time, one of the most entertaining and a fine example of the work of a master-craftsman filmmaker.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,AMAZING GRACE is a second-class film on a first-class theme. The film smolders for almost two hours without ever catching emotional fire. Some enormous liberties were taken with history.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Perhaps more Masterpiece Theatre than motion picture, Amazing Grace nevertheless tells a story that's compelling enough to compensate for the occasional stuffiness.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Don't miss this film.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Amazing Grace marks an unforgettable and regrettable time in world history while highlighting a few who valiantly set out to right the wrongs.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,History as one might wish it to be taught to an earnest child.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"All the elements work harmoniously together: beautiful settings, an extremely talented cast who bring the characters to life, gorgeous costuming and a rich script that informs and delights.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"""Amazing"" indeed.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Illuminates how key transformative historical moments play out in the business of everyday life.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"There's so much story here that the characters don't have quite enough room to breathe, but it's still a fascinating look at a time, and a man, worth remembering.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Amazing Grace's examination of men in power moved to change risks ridicule and righteousness for a smart take on history.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"It is one of the world's great songs, and now it has a worthy movie to go with it.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"It is to be hoped that Amazing Grace is not the only, or the last, cinematic celebration of 200th anniversary of abolition, for there are more stories to tell, more imaginatively.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The movie emerges in the end as a stirring and -- cover your ears, kids -- educational ode to the political power an individual with a cause can inflict on the morally bankrupt status quo.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,So much to admire and so little to amaze.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Accessibility is one of the movie's virtues: without dumbing down, it makes the workings of Parliament seem as gripping as a good suspense thriller.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Grufudd is fine, passionate and single-minded, though overly Romantic, and quietly upstaged by the extraordinary Benedict Cumberbatch.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Michael Apted channels history, but Grace is amazing for the modern sensibilities of its 18th-century saints.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Gruffudd's Wilberforce lacks charisma and the House of Commons scenes are interminable. Worthy shouldn't mean dull. What a waste.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"the film, like its central character, is resolute in its objective. Perhaps too resolute.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Apted directs with a firm hand and the film has been gorgeously shot by Remi Adefarasin. The large cast is generally good, with Gruffudd serving as the strong anchor.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"The whole thing feels a bit smug and complacent, as if having a worthwhile subject were the only requirement for making a worthwhile film, and Apted directs in a respectable ""Masterpiece Theatre"" style that effectively drains away any inherent drama.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"While the subject matter is ripe for investigation, the film isn't quite up to the challenge.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Amazing Grace thoughtfully explores the issue of slavery without sermonizing or losing sight of the fact that modern audiences still need to connect with relatable characters no matter how important the subject matter.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"While there is plenty to hold our interest in William Wilberforce's noble battle to abolish slavery in 18th Century Britain, as a film, Amazing Grace is overzealous and gets bogged down by details","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Impressively directed, politically relevant and occasionally inspirational, this is an enjoyable, engaging drama with strong performances from its talented cast.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,A very decent contribution to the present bicentennial celebrations of the parliamentary bill that outlawed the slave trade in the British empire.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Apted's unexpected crowd-pleaser is inspirational, but also surprisingly entertaining.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,It's neither amazing nor graceful.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A fascinating story, a great cast, but average in its presentation.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Skilfully written and directed, the film is an involving drama, even if it's overly worthy and sentimental.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A decent cast under Michael Apted's direction does its best, but it's dull, naive and dramatically inert.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"A good -- and important -- story, not always well told.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"As a period piece, it's remarkably detailed, smartly written, and likably acted.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Who'd have thought that the most compelling and thoughtful film to be presented during Black History Month would be a formal British import set in 18th century England with men running around in wigs?,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"There's a lot of good intentions behind Amazing Grace, but the movie's a bore, swirling into the minutia of antiquated British law.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"I'm not sure what was a bigger problem for me, though--that the story jumped around so much, or that the tone did, too.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace proves to be an invaluable history lesson, but a rather boring film.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,Earnest drama about fervent English abolitionist.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"In a year that offers the occasion for a deeper and richer look at British slavery and abolition, it is a pity that artists of the caliber of Michael Apted and Steven Knight lent their talents to a tamely traditional and misleading film.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Alas, the subject matter is far more interesting than the execution... It's a film bogged down with staid dialogue that reeks of horse manure.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Amazing Grace,"Amazing Grace fails to explain the different social interests lined up against slavery, for many of whom, manufacturers and others, the question was hardly a moral one.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Silence,Eloquent direction lifts this beyond a genre whodunit.,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television"
The Silence,"Nice, but nothing remarkable.","Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television"
The Silence,"Stylish, sexy and deeply emotionally resonant.","Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television"
The Silence,"Given that underwhelming police thriller The Silence is technically a made-for-TV movie, it might not be counted against helmer Cate Shortland as yet another example of the dreaded disappointing sophomore follow-up.","Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television"
The Silence,...an egregiously slow-paced piece of work that works neither as a character study nor as a police procedural...,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television"

The Situation,Awkward and half-digested.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"Philip Haas's deftly paced, well-written, and brilliantly infuriating Iraq War thriller is not only the strongest of recent geopolitical hotspot flicks but one that has been designed for maximal agitation.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"An overstuffed, unengaging drama.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Situation,"The Situation is promoting itself as the first American dramatic feature film to deal with the occupation of Iraq. While that may be true, it turns out not to matter that much.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"The film would have made a serviceable drama, perhaps, if [writer] Steavenson and [director] Haas weren't so inured to trite utterances.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Situation,"A gripping briefing on the post-Saddam morass of Iraq. The tactical calculus used by sheiks, insurgents, CIA operatives, soldiers, and civilians is ugly, but it's not inscrutable.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"There are a half dozen people in colorful supporting roles all of whom have their own truths. And all of whom are far more interesting, as characters and actors, than [Connie Nielsen].","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"The Situation' is bound to stir up controversy because of the way Americans are portrayed, and anything that gets people talking and thinking is for the good. It brings the war home, where our soldiers should be.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Situation,"A pretty lousy movie in general, though it's the film's somewhat accusatory Iraq War subject matter that's getting it some attention -- deserved or not -- that makes the whole thing a little distasteful.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Situation,"I don't think this movie sheds any new light on 'the situation', but it could have, and it's a shame that it didn't.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Delirious,Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt are easily the best odd couple the movies have seen since Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.,"Comedy, Drama"
Delirious,"Delirious is definitive DiCillo: goofy and cartoonish at the edges, at times a little obvious in its caricature of our celebrity-obsessed culture, but humble and funny enough to compel viewers to overlook its flaws.","Comedy, Drama"
Delirious,Delirious sizzles as long as it loiters in the R. Crumb universe of geeky losers who keep their homicidal urges at least barely in check.,"Comedy, Drama"

Interview,"While it is never dull, and occasionally sparks, material fails to ignite.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"It is a smart film in its humor, its subject, and its execution. Van Gogh could not have done better himself, and that is perhaps the best possible homage to this fallen artist.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Buscemi's adaptation of slain director Theo van Gogh's 2003 film aims to be a sexually and emotionally charged drama about power games, but the execution leaves much to be desired.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"No surprise that Buscemi can carry off this kind of performance, but Miller holds up her end, and is a magnificent tease.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview can be a harrowing experience, but it's a highly skilled, emotionally gripping one.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview is chiefly a showcase for actors Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller, as well as a case study in how to cinematically cope with stagy material.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"This toxic hate at first sight sly entrapment is a deliciously wicked concoction of mutual suspicion, contempt and above all fame game obsessive co-dependency that exists between the worlds of entertainment and the corporate media.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,The least concrete and most artificial of Buscemi's films. But that's as much because of the situation as Buscemi and David Schechter's slippery script.,"Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,Driven by a really smart script and strong performances by one of the most unlikely film pairings in many years.,"Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,Any doubts as to whether Sienna Miller is a gifted actress should be laid to rest by Interview.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen as this terrific psychological game of cat and mouse unfolds. The incredibly sexy Sienna Miller burns up the screen with raw, sensual star power. She's hot","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"Premise of the Dutch film's remake seems less believable here, but the acting is compelling and believable.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"The back-and-forth between the performers is tensely choreographed, and Buscemi does a good job opening up the action, which mostly takes place in a Manhattan loft.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Buscemi's Interview moves forward in static bursts that are contained by the avid, yet unobtrusive direction and the intensity of the two principals.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview doesn't say anything new regarding our obsession with celebrity or, to paraphrase Janet Malcolm, the moral indefensibility of journalism. But the way [Buscemi and Miller] psychologically thrust and parry more than carries the film.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Since this unconvincing, contrived imitation only runs less than 90 minutes, the last half, combined with Sienna Miller's stunning beauty, almost makes it worth seeing.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview is mannered, implausible, and stagy, but queasily compelling all the same.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Pierre is such a weasel, Katya is such a narcissist and the outcome seems so pre-determined, it's hard to care whose belt gets the notch. The adroit performances of Buscemi and Miller almost make it matter.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"Interview is literate, well-paced and played at perfect pitch by Sienna Miller and director Steve Buscemi. I didn't buy it for more than two minutes.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Vaporous and chilled to freezing, Interview lacks a single honest moment, but it does have plenty of diverting ones.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Buscemi's strength is his build up of the characters and he does well as both director and star.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"At film's end, we happily say adieu to a pair who deserve each other more than they imagine.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Though the pic is as talky as anything by Erich Rohmer,the dialogue is riveting.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"I frankly could not care about either of the people on screen. She comes off as a spoiled, manipulative and nasty woman and he is equally repellent.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller exude a raw sensuality in this steamy, character-driven drama which unfolds like a cross between Sleuth and Swept Away. Who'd ever expect to hear 'Steve Buscemi' and 'raw sensuality' in the same sentence?","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"I've sat through so many claustrophobic examples of the genre I forgot how exhilarating, how pure a great one could be. Interview is a great one -- electric as theater and cinema.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,Has the kind of insight you won't find in Us Weekly.,"Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"Despite the fact that both protagonists are equally appalling, the screenplay seems to have a soft spot for the woman. However, this doesn't take away from the fun of watching the two characters tear each other to pieces.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Sharp dialogue and good performances keep it interesting. The film suggests a level of talent in Sienna Miller that she rarely gets a chance to show.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Any questions about Miller's abilities as an actress should be set to rest by this performance.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Despite a few interesting twists and ambiguities, the main revelation -- that the reporter is an insufferable snob -- doesn't seem worth the 84 minutes devoted to spelling it out.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Kind of fascinating, especially in the ways that Buscemi and Miller make their performances into commentaries on the types of characters they play. When actors are really turned loose to play actors, they can achieve merciless accuracy.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Ultimately, pointless. One comes away from Interview exhausted.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Though I'm not familiar with Van Gogh's 2003 version, Buscemi's is implausible and even irritating, despite some nice atmospherics and a decent performance by the director.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,Mr. Buscemi and Ms. Miller prove that they are fully up to the task of carrying a whole movie on their shoulders without any help from the other characters.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Like a one-act off-Broadway play that's wandered onto the movie screen...a sporadically amusing talkathon, but a pretty shallow and forgettable one.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"Interview slyly keeps you watching, wondering who will emerge from this long night's journey.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,The subject matter is certainly American enough.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"I'll just say that Buscemi, who also directed and co-wrote, knows a lot about making movies but little about journalism.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"A thoughtful, challenging piece of work.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"What they're doing is so uninteresting, and their characters so unlikable, that it becomes an exercise in futility.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,Buscemi's film conveys the spirit of its source material but doesn't make a satisfying transmogrification out of its homage.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Miller delivers her strongest yet performance in this offbeat black comedy, which [is] intriguing, but a little draggy.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,This movie keeps falling out of rhythm just when it should be picking up pace. It's a fitful piece of wrong beginnings and false ends.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview feels more like a lab experiment/tribute than a committed, personal drama, leaving us with the sense that Buscemi wanted to feel more connected to this material than he actually did.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"After some impressive banter that hints at interesting character insights, the film loses steam at the halfway mark.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"In revealing the reporter and star's many efforts at artifice and incapacity for truth, Interview tells a conventional story, after all.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview is smart, provocative and disturbing, a searing indictment of media, hypocrisy and the themes Theo Van Gogh explored in his original.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Buscemi and Miller should be roundly praised for the acting chops they display in this thriller.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview, a mood swing of a film with a trap-door resolution, is never much more than an elliptical exercise in symbiotic insincerity.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"A battle of who couldn't care less in which two parties' disinterest collides into a spark-filled festival of mutual loathing, attempted manipulation and resentment.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Remaking a 2003 original by the slain Dutch director Theo van Gogh, Buscemi has produced a charmingly perplexing portrait that's anything but a knockoff.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"There is something perversely appealing about this film. Maybe it's the way Interview astutely comments on celebrities and our perceptions of them, as well as questioning the sincerity and truthfulness of the media.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"There's just one hysterical scene after another, ideal for an acting class but off-putting over the course of even a relatively short film like this one.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Emotional honesty in the service of nonsense is still nonsense, no matter how many scabs it manages to pick at.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"Pretty far from being a great movie, but it's not without its pleasures -- mostly due to the performers.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Ultimately, this two-hander feels limited in scale, but frisky and diverting while it's on.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"As an exercise in preconception-shattering, it works reasonably well. But as the characters veer between petulance and intimacy and back again - often within the same verbal exchange - the situation never really rings true.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Stagey filming aside, this is a sharp and controlled study of celebrity obsession.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview is well-made but depends almost entirely on its acting. Neither of the two principals let it down, even when the screenplay isn't quite as sharp as it could have been.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Sienna Miller as an airhead celeb more famous for her sex life than her movies? Quite a stretch for the British actress.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"It pretends to be about the games of deceit that go on between men and women, but it's really just a squib on the culture of celebrity, and the cynical conclusion that's meant to pull us up short is feeble and silly beyond patience.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"The friskiness of this pas de deux is something, and the acting duet enough of a selling point.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"A talky, tricksy but never particularly convincing or involving drama.","Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,The constant see-sawing of emotion eventually becomes repetitive and wearisome.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"There's some nicely written dialogue in this remake of a foreign movie, but it's all extremely unsatisfying thanks to a so-what? ending and the script's inability to make us warm to its two principal characters.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Snappy exchanges, smart acting and slick directing go to make up a wickedly entertaining work that's hugely enjoyable. A deft story about modern-day celebrity culture, it also proves what a talent Buscemi is as a director.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Interview is a decently acted two-hander fringe play that doesn't deserve to be on film.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Essentially it's a game of verbal ping-pong and, even if cynicism wins the day too easily in the end, the interplay is lively and intriguing.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"Interview is a decent showcase for the talents of its stars, but may leave you in doubt over the talents of its originator. Hopefully the other Van Gogh remakes in production will sport more smartness and subtlety.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"The wonderful thing about Interview is that we have no idea where it is going to lead. It's honest, conflicted and surprising, as journalist and actress battle words and emotions in a potent drama that takes us to unexpected places","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,I can't get on the Sienna Miller bandwagon. I can damn with faint praise: she's perfectly competent as an actor -- but that's it.,"Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,"From its opening frame to its final revelation, Interview hums with life.","Art House & International, Drama"
Interview,Interview comes across more like an acting exercise than a workable story.,"Art House & International, Drama"

Interview,"The movie really started off on a good note, but then it just got repetitive.","Art House & International, Drama"

The Ten,Most of the segments are as clueless about their designated commandment as they are about what's supposed to be funny.,Comedy
The Ten,A blasphemous parody so painful to sit through it seems designed by the Almighty as punishment for heathens and sinners.,Comedy
The Ten,...brings to mind the fondly remembered Kentucky Fried Movie/Amazon Women on the Moon anthos from the '70s and '80s.,Comedy
The Ten,"Rudd, whose wry deadpan proved indispensable in Judd Apatow comedies like 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' and 'Knocked Up,' is used here mostly as a straight man, the host in charge of introducing stories that drift along without any real destination.",Comedy
The Ten,"The beyond-goofy collection of Commandment-inspired vignettes has funny moments, but it's a wildly uneven anthology, with three or four clunkers for every genuine chuckle.",Comedy
The Ten,"More than simply unentertaining, The Ten comes from an America of silly, laddish self-regard and hollow protest.",Comedy

The Happening,"The movie is so inept in terms of coherent, cohesive storytelling and in some other filmmaking aspects that it deserves to be laughed off the screen.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"Happening promises a change of pace, but the magic only lasts for a few moments, then it's all open acre isolation, media blackouts, and mysterious threats with extended, mouth-agape pauses.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"There are scattered moments of craft throughout, but the gulf between his lofty aspirations and feeble accomplishments has seldom been wider or more chuckle-inducing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan's still trying to take the story seriously-this is, horror of horrors, a message film-but his atypically unmeasured direction is all shock and no awe.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Were the first 45 minutes of The Happening not as rattlingly effective as they are, one could chalk the film up as mediocre. There is such untapped potential, though, that the dishonest places Shyamalan chooses to take his audience are maddening.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"I'm always amused by the sort of backlashes that Shyamalan is in right now. Well, M. Night Shyamalan makes vague, subtle fantasy thrillers. If you've outgrown it, don't blame him.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"Shyamalan tries to give the events a scientific underpinning. But his logic is spotty, so what are meant to be eerie moments are not convincing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Both silly and preachy.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous. The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan movies demand that you surrender to his way of telling stories. If you're up for that, you should go.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"The screenplay is a mess, filled with unfunny moments of intended humor and funny moments of unintended humor.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"In a Hollywood summer otherwise dominated by comic-book superheroes, blazing action spectacles, snickering teen sex comedies and computer-generated fantasy, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening is something different -- and a pleasant surprise.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"It's an entertaining movie, which is half the game, but it's not scary, which it should be. Neither is it something to be taken seriously, though it's intended to be.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan's such an eager recycler, grinding out the same ideas and images again and again. The man who showed such promise less than a decade ago has been leaving a diminishing creative footprint ever since.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The story essentially stops moving midway through. All that's going to occur, in terms of building any true dramatic tension, already has happened by this point.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"We don't care. It doesn't matter if they live or die, if there's a happy ending, or some kind of twist. The Happening is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or -- best of all -- not to bother with.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The plot is absurdly preachy and illogical, and the dialogue uneven, with stinging lines followed by stinkers.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Executed in bland and remote fashion, with little in the way of compelling suspense, mystery or directorial craft. Think of the worst Spielberg thriller or one of Hitchcock's dull late career works.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"If Shyamalan's ever going to do something different then he should have made something manic, dark and twisted. But that's not Happening.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"There's a long tradition of receiving messages from burning bushes, but jiggling bushes are not to be trusted, and neither are filmmakers who ask us to shiver in their leafy midst.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Not a complete return to form (by far), but also not a failure. Let's be fair--this is the best film Shyamalan has put out in years.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,No one will watch any of Shyamalan's recent films twice. A movie that features Wahlberg suggesting everyone try to outrun the wind can barely be watched once.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The final explanation, which comes as no surprise, is more preposterous than profound. If you want to see a scary movie about humans wreaking havoc on their planet, watch An Inconvenient Truth instead.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Wahlberg turns in one of his worst performances ever, but then he's saddled with preposterous scenes (like one where he tries to placate a ficus) and such lame lines as ""Could this really be happening?"" Funny, I was wondering the same thing myself.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A subtle, measured work, which means there will be many who find it dull and pointless.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"It's creepy, silly fun. And if it came from anyone else, it would be recognized as such. One thing is certain: The man hasn't lost his ability to entertain.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Basically it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode blown up to feature length.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Nobody gets the time or the treatment to become a character you'd actually care about, which makes the general planet-in-peril theme of the movie kind of moot.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,No mere actor could possibly escape the toxic dialogue oozing from M. Night's pen -- that's merciless.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,It's downright stupid.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,The shock value wears off quickly and writer-director Shyamalan strands us in a boring cautionary tale with an infantile eco-message about humanity needing to live in harmony with nature -- or else.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Mr. Shyamalan is plagued by a bad case of Robin Williams Syndrome, characterized by a desire to inspire and change the world through mediocre entertainment â"" in this case, accompanied by ample and frequently creative bloodshed.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"If this was the movie to rescue the reputation of self-styled genius Shyamalan after the disaster of Lady in the Water, then it's back to the old drawing board.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Shyamalan's approach is more effective than smash-and-grab plot-mongering. His use of the landscape is disturbingly effective. The performances by Wahlberg and Deschanel bring a quiet dignity to their characters.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A comeback for the director, but not quite enough of one...an almost equal combination of genuine creepiness and absolute foolishness.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"...bad in more than just an everyday, sure-does-suck kind of way.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The film becomes less comprehensible as it goes along, and the audience -- expecting a patented M. Night ending -- is left with no answers, explanation, or narrative closure.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,It's also a bit sneaky of Shyamalan to set us up for a paranoid 9/11 thriller and then go all Greenpeace on us. He's trying to be socially conscious but he doesn't have the reformist's temperament. He has the temperament of a self-infatuated messiah.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,You feel like you're not watching the end of the world but the end of a career.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Shyamalan wants the rustling of wind through greenery to evoke the same shudders in The Happening that the gathering of birds did in Hitchcock's The Birds,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,The greatest excuse yet to get that anti-M. Night petition started. The last thing we want is a future of Shyamalan films with the knowledge that we all could have done something sooner.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Shyamalan crafts a somewhat chilling cautionary tale; it just might have been more chilling if he had been a little less cautious.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"M. Night Shyamalan has morphed from ""the next Spielberg"" to a punching bag for critics and audiences alike. The Happening reminds us why.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"If what audiences are looking for is a thrill ride, or even a pervasive eeriness, The Happening's just not happening.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,The Happening features an effectively stylized physical environment: rarely have clouds drifting overhead and wind blowing through trees and a sunny day been filmed so ominously.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The Happening is a film of such shockingly appalling writing, dreadful acting and ham-fisted, ungainly execution that it plays better as a comedy than the thriller it was meant to be.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,An impressive thriller which acknowledges the mystery that lies behind the marvels and the terrors of the natural world.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Bad and weird.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Another disappointment from M, despite some disturbing violence and chilly moments.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The movie is a bummer, from beginning to end.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A tantalising, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Maybe Shyamalan has been plugged into those other worlds for too long. Judging from what is on offer here, he needs to become more acquainted with the emotional language of this one.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"While hardly his worst work, this film is so far off his high water mark that it begs the question of whether M. Night Shyamalan will ever truly return.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"If you have seen the trailers online or on T.V., you can just save your money and wait for the rental on this one. All of the best moments are in the promos.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Another case of elegant filmmaking kneecapped by a thunderingly stupid concept.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Shyamalan's essentially made a sociopathic movie.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"'The Happening' may not be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie, but it's his most provocative one.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Lacks scares, wit, humor and acting, and Zooey Deschanel, alas, has lost her cuteness.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"It's clear that a once creative director is now running out of fumes, trying extremely hard to find something that hasn't been done before. The result is laughable.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Where the hell is Act III?,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"While there are certainly ideas behind it, the film lacks the bloated self-importance that plagued the director's last two efforts. This time, Shyamalan seems content merely to entertain us, and that's enough.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,The Happening suggests [Shyamalan's] (con) artist's touch is waning a bit.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"On a brighter note, the Wayans brothers have new material to make Scary Movie 5.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A creepy cautionary eco-thriller than neither cautions nor thrills. Instead of being full of dread, it's just dreadful.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan's direction always seems so serious that it's easy to imagine he may be screwing up when he draws laughs, but I'd lay down money that many of these were deliberate.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,If Shyamalan wanted to commit career suicide he couldn't have chosen a more likely vehicle than this laugh inducing 'thriller.',"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"What's more annoying than when a mediocre movie constantly males allusions to much better pictures? I know, it's when you wait an hour and a half for a solution this pathetic.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Ouch. 'Lady in the Water' was a dud. And for its ghastliness, filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan took one to the chin. He got back up again, though, to make 'The Happening.'This one's gonna hurt.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Someday someone will stop bankrolling Shyamalan's dumb dreams and keep this kind of tripe from happening.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"... M. Night desperately needs to find that special someone whose opinion he'll listen to when they say,'No! BAD writer-producer-director! NOT a good idea!'","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The film does manage to build some tension, since the survival of the group remains in question right up to the end.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"'The Happening' works in early spurts, but apparently Shyamalan ran out of ideas once he came up with his uniquely insidious killer.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Works as an effective and brutally horrifying antithesis to the usual explosive summer fare...,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"There's never an ounce of suspense, mystery, or surprise.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,I did find myself caught up in Shyamalan's apocalyptic world for a time -- before some really bad dialogue or acting would shake me out of it.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A monster movie desperately seeking a monster, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening doesn't make sense, much less The Sixth Sense.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"It's engrossing one minute and stupefying the next, off and on, off and on, for ninety minutes.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"For Night, The Happening is a little blip on his career flatline. The guy just may pull through.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,The true disaster on display in The Happening is Shyamalan's career hitting rock bottom.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,﻿All that's missing is the head alien of Plan 9 From Outer Space dropping by to lecture the populace for disrespecting nature: 'Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!',"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"'There are forces at work beyond our understanding,' says Wahlberg. 'Especially beyond my understanding, if you include virtually every force at work.'","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Maybe Shyamalan didn't mean for The Happening to be exciting and dramatic: perhaps the writer-director intended the film to be an exercise in sucking all the life and emotion out of fictional characters.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"A numbing polemical morality tale in dreary doomsday thriller clothing, this dull downer for all its mass panic attack high alert mode, may be more effective in unintentionally boring people to death.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"...a minor, not quite successful film, but for M. Night Shyamalan - whose career has been circling the drain for some time now - it's a step back from the abyss.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Só podemos deduzir que o próximo projeto de Shyamalan será melhor do que este Fim dos Tempos porque sabemos que ele (ou qualquer outro cineasta) dificilmente seria capaz de fazer algo pior.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"When a movie's best bit arrives during the closing credits, we're all in trouble.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Only half good cinema, seemingly the result of its maker's stunted belief/determination in both himself and his audience.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,A better title for M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening would be Nonsense. It's like an amusement park ride that has no reason for being -- and no meaning -- besides visceral excitation. Only difference is that The Happening isn't fun.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"The slight premise, coupled with some very bad performances by the cast as well as a screenplay filled with ham-fisted dialogue makes for a film that's not scary and borders on being ridiculous at times.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"For a movie with the potential for so much global-warming electricity, it's disappointingly low on voltage.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,What you end up with is a cross between Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow and Shyamalan's Signs.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,"...some nice creepy moments -- but other moments, and more, of (presumably) unintended humor.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"[N]owhere near the level of The Sixth Sense, and not quite as good as the subsequent Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village, but at least it suggests that the awfulness of Lady in the Water may have been an aberration.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan's ideas might have more impact in a half-hour 'Twilight Zone' episode, where they would be shorn of some of the pretensions that seem to be mandatory in the feature-length work of a one-time Best Director Oscar nominee.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"It's hard to believe that at one time Shyamalan was being touted as the next Steven Spielberg by Newsweek magazine, but if things keep going the way they are now, Uwe Boll might end up being a better comparison. And boy is that depressing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,Mark Wahlberg's sturdy performance saves The Happening from becoming a protracted Saturday Night Live spoof of M. Night Shyamalan movies.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The Happening,There are some creepy moments but overall The Happening is a bit of a non-event.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Whether or not you'll like The Happening might very well depend on how much you like apocalyptic scenarios in your movies. I love 'em, myself.

The Happening,"Usually Shyamalan can hide his limitations as a screenwriter behind his skill as a director. Here, that skill fails him as well, and the whole movie falls apart.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"Shyamalan creates another urban myth with this slow burning thriller. But it never quite comes to life, due to stiff directing and acting","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,It is the first film of his career that feels incompetent and utterly gratuitous at times.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"
The Happening,"M. Night Shyamalan offers up low-intensity thrills that fail to match the shivery shudders of his best work (THE SIXTH SENSE, SIGNS). His patented approach - mixing domestic drama with horror - plays out on a much larger canvas.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Molière,"The film begins on a serious note, requiring an adjustment on the part of the audience toward its more prevalent comic tone. Once that transition is made, the experience of Moliere is an enjoyable one.",Comedy
Molière,Tirard adds just a touch of tragedy for the humor to fully resonate and summons the spirit of his inspiration perhaps more effectively than director John Madden rendered the Bard in heat.,Comedy

Molière,"A bit curate's eggy, sometimes funny and always goodlooking, but neither a particularly good tribute to a great playwright nor a comedy with much weight behind it.",Comedy
Molière,"It's impossible to avoid comparison with Shakespeare in Love, which similarly made out that many of the great man's plays were really disguised autobiography; but the earlier film had a lightness of touch and variety of tone missing from this one.",Comedy
Molière,"Moliere is an exceptionally likeable period comedy, powered by impeccable performances from Luchini and the wonderful Laura Morante.",Comedy
Molière,"Just as you should never judge a book by its cover, never judge a film by its press release. Moliere was the most touching, funny film on show this week.",Comedy
Molière,"It's a wonderfully witty film - très bien, in fact.",Comedy
Molière,"Both a glittering showcase for a literary giant's comic genius and a first-class farce in its own right. By turns funny, mysterious, suffering and sexy, Romain Duris again proves he's the most charismatic French actor working today.",Comedy
Molière,"When the French do period drama well, they tend to do it very, very well.",Comedy
Molière,"This is no biopic, but pure fantasy, a sort of ""Molière in Love"" infused with the bittersweet romantic spirit of the playwright's work.",Comedy
Molière,"Using a gap in the French playright's bio as a starting point, Tirad's film is a mediocre stab at a Shakespeare in Love-style serio comedy that concocts an imaginary scenario about the ambitious-but-starving young artist--Tim Grierson",Comedy
Molière,"Romain Duris may be a superb actor, but a light comedian he ain't. You need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing.",Comedy
Molière,"The film feels distinctly skinny, as if half the cast haven't arrived. The symmetry of the story is almost too perfect. Several leaps of faith are wildly silly.",Comedy
Molière,"A witty, lively period drama that expertly blends comedy and tragedy to create a worthy French counterpart to Shakespeare In Love.",Comedy

Molière,"A funny, witty, bright, and well-acted costume drama about a fictional turning point in the life of the famous French playwright Moliere.",Comedy
Molière,"Duris, so good in The Beat that My Heart Skipped, is simply marvelous here. His Molière is a complex creature of intelligence, insecurity, sincerity, obstinacy and burgeoning brilliance.",Comedy
Molière,Laura Morante proves once again that she is one of the most intelligent and attractive actresses in the world.,Comedy
Molière,"Festooned with oodles of museum-worthy 17th century sets and costumes, Moliere is the sort of slightly naughty but literate frolic that congratulates the audience for its good taste; in other words, it's a bit of a snooze.",Comedy
Molière,"Molière is as much about the making of a patroness as it is about the gestation of artistic form, for it's she who eggs on the callow playwright to reinvent comedy as serious business with a powerful moral core.",Comedy
Molière,"What's missing, alas, is a greater sense of surprise that might keep the film from feeling somewhat rote.",Comedy
Molière,"A well-played but ultimately superfluous assortment of your favorite Moliere scenes strung together by a thread-thin plot that emulates, but in no way replaces, the still-sparkling originals.",Comedy
Molière,One of the year's best films to date.,Comedy
Molière,A period piece enlivened with slapstick and mischievous wit.,Comedy
Molière,This movie about the crucible of imagination has none of its own.,Comedy
Molière,"Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known as Molière, wrote more than 30 plays, every one of them a hundred times more witty and insightful than the movie Molière.",Comedy
Molière,"The actors elevate what might have been fluff into a genuinely moving tale, and the action is so much fun that it doesn't even matter if you've seen Molière's plays before.",Comedy
Molière,"It may not be a brilliant act of speculative history, but it's a clever and respectable one.",Comedy
Molière,"A sweet and silly comedy reminiscent of Shakespeare in Love, it's lushly filmed and gorgeously set and costumed.",Comedy
Molière,"A conventional biopic would probably elide most of this period, which was before the pioneering satirist scandalized the establishment with plays like Tartuffe, but the disarming farce Molire, to its great credit, isn't really a biopic.",Comedy
Molière,"Molière is a restful diversion, perhaps too restful, but still acceptable. And the actors go a long way toward bringing it off.",Comedy
Molière,A delightful romp with an intriguing story that could have been cut by 30 minutes and not missed a beat.,Comedy
Molière,Laurent Tirard gives us a delightful and witty costume piece about what might have happened in those never-accounted-for months.,Comedy
Molière,Tirard presents Molière like a 17th century Woody Allen - a playwright who yearns to write drama when his forte is farce.,Comedy
Molière,A blithe but satisfying French confection.,Comedy
Molière,"The two lead actors are a sight to behold: Romain Duris (Moliere), with his long chin, crooked mouth, asymmetrical moustache, and bewildered eyes, plays off the thin lips and boneless cheeks of Fabrice Luchini's Jourdain.",Comedy
Molière,Director and co-writer Laurent Tirard's pleasant but tame approach to his birth-of-a-major-world-dramatist portrait has its virtues.,Comedy
Molière,"Underplays its biggest opportunities for laughs, like the film is standing at the plate but unwilling to swing the bat.",Comedy
Molière,"Woefully miscast as the seminal 17th-century French farceur Molière, the intense, black-maned young French movie star Romain Duris never seems more comfortable than the brief moments when he's rotting in a dank jail.",Comedy
Molière,Moliere is an amusing mix of fact and fiction about the life of the brilliant 17th-century French playwright.,Comedy
Molière,"In making a comedy about a writer famed for his perfectly tuned wit, the filmmakers have inspired other expectations. The result is as off-putting as biting into a confection in which the sugar has been replaced by salt.",Comedy
Molière,Moliere hardly matches the clever mockery of its 17th century inspiration.,Comedy
Molière,"Through homage to Moliere's works and by the film's own example, [director] Tirard reminds us that comedy can provoke both laughter and thought.",Comedy
Molière,"As a piece of speculative biography, the movie is unpersuasive.",Comedy
Molière,"It nevertheless contains enough wit and charm to keep things humming along even when the plot threatens to bog down into a Gallic version of a typical episode of ""Love American Style.""",Comedy
Molière,"If you've enjoyed Moliere's work, you'll enjoy the film.",Comedy
Molière,"Like the playwright's comedies, at its best Moliere shows the depths beneath the archetypes.",Comedy
Molière,"The movie leaves initially cynical Molière believing in true love after all, the rock star undone by Hallmark.",Comedy
Molière,"Lost in the exercise is any insight into Molière's writing or any relevance to today, making his achievements seem more frivolous -- and considerably less amusing -- than they actually were.",Comedy
Molière,"An extravagant and thoroughly irresistible story of intrigue, romance, comedy and artistic inspiration.",Comedy
Molière,"Director and cowriter Laurent Tirard are clearly under the sway of Shakespeare in Love, but the talented Duris is miscast as the wily Moliere, and Moliere has none of Shakespeare's giddy charm.",Comedy
Molière,"I can only wonder what theatre gods Molière angered during his lifetime to deserve such ragtag biographical treatment, but let's hope Molière settles the debt.",Comedy
Molière,It turns out that a deep appreciation of the human condition can be accomplished through comedy as much as through drama. At least that's what Moliere learns,Comedy
Molière,"The unraveling of this same world, 100 years later, was portrayed in Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, next to whose gilded atmosphere the merely glossy Molière looks like a work of naturalism.",Comedy
Molière,"Certainly attractive to look at, but what goes on in front of the manicured lawns and sumptuous seventeenth-century interiors is considerably less amusing than it might be.",Comedy
Molière,"The cast is very good. The chemistry between Duris and Morante smolders, while Luchini makes a convincing, bungling aristocrat.",Comedy
Molière,It's like a breeze so slight it doesn't leave a tickle.,Comedy
Molière,Connoisseurs of Sun King-era costumes and decor are the most likely fans of this impeccably produced but unimaginative pseudo-biopic...,Comedy
Molière,"There's not a single moment that you haven't already seen in a different, better period film.",Comedy
Molière,"The film illuminates little about Molière himself, but what do you expect from a movie that has the depth of a kiddie pool?",Comedy
Molière,"""Moliere"" actually tells a funny, involving story that really does seem inspired by its subject, rather than just lazily cribbing from his work.",Comedy
Molière,"An amusing and clever film, often laugh-out-loud funny and filled with sparkling characters.",Comedy
Molière,"As the film picks up momentum, however, it becomes the story of an aimless young man who discovers his own brilliant wit and learns how to use it. As he gets closer to the scathing, fearless Moliere we know and love, so does the movie.",Comedy
Molière,For theater people and French literature buffs...a delightful game of spot-the-reference...,Comedy
Molière,"Un cuadro social de época vivaz y divertido, con estupendo elenco y una cuota de romance y emotividad.",Comedy
Molière,"A sumptuous pleasure to behold, with its elegantly designed motifs, infectious energy conveying the emotional sensibility of the time, and splendid comic mischief satirizing the hypocrisy of both the bourgeoisie and aristocracy.",Comedy
Molière,A breezy historical romance with a strong knack for comedy.,Comedy
Molière,"Deluxe tribute to the playwright gets by, surprisingly, as much by romantic poignancy as farce...it's hard to dislike a picture so in Love with its subject.",Comedy
Molière,A sophisticated and literate biographical speculation is the basis of this witty and entertaining portrait of the titular artist.,Comedy
Molière,"Witty lines, sumptuous settings, manicured lawns and horses with carriages provide the setting for this frivolous romp that caresses history as it plays with the misadventures of French playwright Molière %u2026 With just the right balance of playfulness",Comedy

Alexandra,The mixture of the surreal and concrete feels remarkably accurate: a verité depiction of war with a profound ghostly quality.,Drama

The Lucky Ones,"Soldiers deserve a better tribute than this trite, phony dreck.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"It's hard to find the genuine heartfelt moments in The Lucky Ones, a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the U.S., under the clutter of narrative contrivances and coincidences.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The drama's one glaring weakness is that its contrivances are far too obvious...Despite that, the unexpectedly light, sometimes humorous story is still enormously affecting.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Sometimes, however, empty, contrived fantasies are just empty, contrived fantasies, as is certainly the case with this embarrassingly phony cross between Grace Is Gone, Home of the Brave and, believe it or not, Twister.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"It isn't unpleasant to spend two hours with these three soldiers, although it might have been more enjoyable to spend the time getting to know them rather than force-feeding them artificial road bumps.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Though Iraq War is in the background, Lucky Ones is yet another disappointing 9/11 film; it's a known fact that for a road picture to work, you need interesting encounters, revelations, self-discoveries, humor and color, all of which are in short supply","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,It's something of a well-intentioned mess.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Perhaps if The Lucky Ones wasn't so crammed with incidents, the absurd coincidences wouldn't be so grating.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The Lucky Ones isn't dull, and the actors do quite nicely, especially McAdams, who's feisty, gorgeous, and as mercurial as a mood ring.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,It's finally all too familiar.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Even when it feels contrived, The Lucky Ones is enhanced by Mr. Pea, Ms. McAdams and especially the terrific, always surprising Mr. Robbins, in performances so likable and well timed they carry you aloft, like a flag.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,A refreshing departure from the normal 'soldier's story' movies we've seen in recent years.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"With one head-gnawing plot contrivance after another, it may think it's the wacky Iraq version of Easy Rider but is more like this year's Around the Bend or Diamonds.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"From start to finish, there is not one single scene on display here that contains even a smidgen of reality.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Moments of real trauma are interrupted with sitcom wackiness, all of it connected by a terribly hokey musical score.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"A road movie with no purpose, and a war drama with no bite.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Writer/director Neil Burger...takes a big step back with ""The Lucky Ones,"" a sitcomy road movie that throws together three hard luck Iraq war vets.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The actual lucky ones will be sitting in a different movie theater, watching anything but this.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"In the same way much conventional wisdom about the war is half-baked, The Lucky Ones is awash in stereotypes and generalities.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Director Neil Burger keeps things light, and the actors are more than engaging. ... But there's something centrally pat and predictable about the coincidence-laden story.","Comedy, Drama"

The Lucky Ones,"If The Lucky Ones wants to seem like anything more than war vets thrust into a sitcom, it should try going five minutes without a contrivance.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The plot functions in a rudimentary fashion setting up one contrived complication after another, engendering a desire, despite a few amusing scenes and pleasant company, for the trio to arrive at their respective destinations as soon as possible.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,The Lucky Ones takes a decent premise -- three soldiers returning from Iraq facing domestic challenges upon their arrival home -- and crams so much forced drama into it that the movie devolves into a hack buddy picture.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,So laid-back and plain that the film leaves almost no impression at all.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Rachel McAdams keeps reminding me how good she is in every role she takes. In this movie, she just glows energy. Acting is one thing. How do you project energy? Through joy, anger and curiosity, she projects this vibe and she is the backbone of the film.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Based on the evidence here, director/co-writer Neil Burger may be the last American who's ambivalent about the Iraq War, and his movie suffers for it.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"While their circumstances may be forced, the three characters feel like real, complex, likable people. That's a real rarity in a film about veterans, no matter what the ideology is.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"There are so many little touches, so many delicate nuances that constantly amaze and inspire, that by the time it was over I almost didn't want their story to come to an end.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"This is not the worst of the Iraq-themed movies of the past few years, and it's possibly the best acted of any of them. But you wish the bonding of these three people wasn't diluted by the trite scenarios and artificial circumstances of their saga.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,The dialogue is often sharp and funny and the performances nicely pitched.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"As they hit the road, the scenes play out like TV sitcom vignettes with little holding the centre together. We find out details about the characters lives, but never feel we know them.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,Each secret is more implausible than the last.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"McAdams and Pea are affectingly vulnerable, while Robbins convinces as a family man with strong paternal instincts.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,The Lucky Ones has plenty of heart and courage. If it only had a brain ...,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"In the end, they laugh together, they cry together and they all learn a little something about this place we call America. At least, that was probably the plan.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Like its lead characters, Lucky is wounded, lost, and impractical, but it has a messy, winning humanity and an agreeably leisurely pace that almost redeems it.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"It gets so preoccupied with all the local color and colorful locals, that it forgets about the people on this journey -- or their ultimate destination.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Cheap, ignorant, tone-deaf and condescending.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,Its lack of emotional thrust doesn't inspire the viewer to feel one way or another.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"As entertainment, the film works sporadically, though Burger never finds a rhythm.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Director and co-writer Neil Burger's drama uses the war as a springboard to tell a darkly funny, and sometimes profoundly moving, story of the men and women who are the warriors.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,It's all merely unbelievable.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,How unusual. How enjoyable.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The chemistry between the three soldiers is strong, but their journey rings hollow.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,The story (by director Burger and Dirk Wittenborn) contains too many coincidences and convergences to wholly ring true.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"By structuring this as a comic road movie, writer-director Neil Burger manages to examine the emotional isolation of returning vets without sinking into a bog of despair.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,What gives these episodes cumulative impact is the group portrait that emerges of a well-meaning country in a state of drift.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,[A] far-fetched take on Iraq War homecomings.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"With a smooth, light touch, The Lucky Ones focuses on the idea that the present and the people who factor into it are all we really have.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,Three Army soldiers on the road in America bond together through a series of preposterous happenings that come across as silly.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Of its genre, it's uncommonly good, and it's also the cheeriest movie about Iraq war vets I've yet seen.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"After running through some pretty contrived paces for much of its running time, The Lucky Ones has some surprises in the last act that ultimately make it more satisfying than it might have been.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,I'm sure a lot of bad fiction has been written about veterans and current soldiers in the Iraq War. It's just not that often that it gets shot and projected on to a big screen.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,The predictable plotting in this well-intentioned salute would be excusable if the dialogue weren't so superficial.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The biggest disappointment is in this script, written by Dirk Wittenborn and Neil Burger who gave us the delightful Illusionistin 2006.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,... reductive and unfunny ... think Coming Home crossed with Vegas Vacation - Cousin Eddie ...,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,...benefits substantially from the strength and charisma of its three leads...,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,War/road trip dramedy is cliched but affecting.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The Iraq war has thus far produced no truly memorable dramatic movies, as opposed to documentaries, and the losing streak continues with The Lucky Ones.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"The direction is functional, workmanlike; Burger never steals the spotlight from his characters.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,Ultimately I was left without any clear notion as to what was being said through the film and why.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"In this interview, The Lucky Ones director Neil Burger speaks about understanding the modern soldier, his surprising casting choice of anti-war activist Tim Robbins as a veteran and why he relates the story while the Iraq conflict continues.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"It feels like the writers were trying for dialogue that sounded natural and improvisational. Instead, it feels scripted and rehearsed. It's all phony balony!","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"If not for the warmth and likability of its characters and those playing them, The Lucky Ones would be a tiresome formula picture.","Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,... captures the manner in which both the smallest and largest events on a road trip can build a sense of camaraderie among three strangers with very little in common.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Lucky Ones,"Their real, unstated missions are more in the nature of relocating their souls and finding some elusive peace of mind.","Comedy, Drama"

Run Fatboy Run,"Although you can see the finish line from the starting shot, Pegg elevates the movie from eye-rolling to forgivably genial with his ace delivery and genuinely entertaining pratfalls.",Comedy
Run Fatboy Run,"It ambles along pleasantly, produces a few chuckles, and is forgotten by the time you pass the popcorn counter on the way out of the theater.",Comedy

Run Fatboy Run,"The sort of flat-footed studio film that takes the basic ingredients of an underground hit, drains them of personality and style, and spits them out as a situation comedy.",Comedy
Run Fatboy Run,The humor tends toward the mildly crass -- bare buttocks and inappropriate scratching are Schwimmer's go-to comedy staples -- and the story is ridiculous.,Comedy

Canvas,"Auds will experience the joy of discovery in Greco's fact-based drama -- not just in its perspective on schizophrenia and the effect of the disease on one Florida family, but in Joe Pantoliano's cliche-demolishing performance.",Drama
Canvas,"The director happens to know the often maligned subject of mental illness well from his own childhood as the son of a psychotic mother, and he embraces it with genuine feeling, emotional spontaneity and absence of consciously formulated dramatic pretense.",Drama
Canvas,Writer-director Joseph Greco's refusal to explain the roots of Mary's madness gives John's desperate desire to summon happier days a bewitching poignancy.,Drama
Canvas,"Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion.",Drama
Canvas,"Despite its admirable qualities, Canvas fizzles and falls into cliche.",Drama
Canvas,An absence of detail means that Canvas teaches little about what it's like to be mentally ill or to know someone who is.,Drama
Canvas,Greco succeeds where many others have failed in giving a real sense of what it is to grow up with a parent who's hobbled by mental illness.,Drama
Canvas,"Greco takes his biggest risk, perhaps, when he puts that boat in water with father and son manning the sails. It could be a mawkish scene that sinks everything that came before it, but like the watercraft that symbolizes so much, the movie remains afloat.",Drama

Canvas,"Canvas is worth seeing for the acting, but the disease-of-the-week conventions and hackneyed visuals pretty well knock the wind out of its sails.",Drama
Canvas,Canvas just doesn't sketch a sufficiently vivid portrait.,Drama
Canvas,"Writer-director Joseph Greco makes a nice feature-film debut telling a true, disturbing story about a 10-year-old boy struggling to cope with a schizophrenic mother.",Drama

Flawless,"It seems irresponsible, if not downright stupid, for the makers of any movie to call their feature Flawless. But the most current film to sport that risky title has a number of serious storytelling flaws.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"The answers to its most intriguing puzzles disappoint, and the final motive provided for this near-perfect scheme can only be described as flawed.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"May not quite live up to the daunting implication of its title, but as a solid piece of beautifully acted and precisely written filmmaking, you'll find nothing better.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"The picture is mildly entertaining, aided strongly by the retro period and Caine's authoritative performance. As for Moore, the script doesn't offer her much - certainly not the intensity that brought her equal parts fame and derision.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"I think if the script had some tweaking, this could have been a great heist film. Instead, it's just another mediocre one.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"For about 100 of its 108 minutes, this film treats the viewer to a stylish, suspenseful roller coaster peppered with all manner of ugly, money-grubbing corporate types.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Demi Moore is excellent as the catalyst for the crime caper with a profoundly personal motive, something we don't discover until late in the film, and Michael Caine is wonderfully dry as the office cleaner with an agenda","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"What a cast - Michael Caine, Demi Moore, Joss Ackland. Yet here it is, released at the fag end of the year just in case anyone notices. It makes you despair.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"There's little by way of thrills. Still, as a caper with a great cast and clever premise, Flawless works, despite its, um, flaws.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction, the plotting, the intrusive modernist production design.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Ignore the dull framing device and this is a watchable period crime drama. Pity about the dull, oft-used title though.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,Fatuous and soulless.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"You will need a very sweet tooth for this kind of thing, and, to be quite frank, the heist itself is not dramatised all that excitingly or clearly. But I quite like thrillers featuring enormous circular vault doors.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Calling a diamond-heist movie Flawless is a valiant choice - especially when it's anything but. Suspense is essential to this genre, but here you couldn't care less what happens next.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"""Hang on lads, I've got a great idea..."" said Michael Caine at the end of The Italian Job. Presumably he didn't mean waiting 40 years before pulling off a caper that wouldn't blow the bloody doors off a rabbit hutch.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Flawless,"A creaky, below-par Brit heist caper that belongs in a dusty vault itself.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Yet for all the imperfections, Flawless is a film you find yourself rooting for. Heists involving a keen sense of history are pleasant to stumble across.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Enjoyable heist thriller with strong performances from Moore and Caine, though the ending is slightly disappointing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,"Terrific performances elevate this extremely low-key heist thriller into something thoroughly intriguing. It may never crank up much excitement, but the 1960s vibe it generates is very cool.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,A mopey character study only half-convincingly tricked out as a heist thriller.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Flawless,The bad pacing and strange infatuation with Moore smoking and wearing high heels results in a picture that lacks snap and labours slowly through the plot twists.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Appaloosa,"The top-heavy plot takes over, and the picture makes a beeline back to tepid convention.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"A smart and funny script, highly entertaining from the first draw, Appaloosa is a taut, captivating tale of the old West with enough bite and modern edge to draw in both fans and non-devotees of the cowboy genre.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Jeremy Irons is miscast as the film's politically driven baddie, but the easy rapport between Harris and Mortensen more than compensates for the minor misstep.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"The parts of it that work, work very well... so much so in fact that the parts which don't simply can't keep up.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have mastered the art of subtle communication, amplifying the believability of their relationship in this ruggedly male bonding tale.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Harris and Mortensen are out to get Irons, and their plan appears to be to talk him to death. It took a lot of stretching to get this to last for two hours.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,The various symbols never coalesce into metaphor so much as they stand stagnant and hollow at the edges of the frame.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"In all, Appaloosa is good as far as it goes -- everything in it feels true -- but I wish that Harris had pushed his ideas further.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Appaloosa is entertaining, certainly, but it feels rather slight and feeble next to some of its more superior recent cohorts in the western genre.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Can Ed Harris, of all people, save the Western for this generation?","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,Squinting Zellweger ruins it. I liked the hats.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"In another era, Harris -- and Mortensen, for that matter -- would have already starred in several westerns. Harris should do more of them; only next time, much less carefully.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,"Enjoyable, frequently offbeat western with an intriguing script and terrific performances from Harris and Mortensen.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"This, though, is not so much a comedy as a western with the ironic undertones that someone like Hawks would appreciate while telling a story such as Rio Bravo.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,The plot is engaging enough but this is best viewed as a buddy movie with a dynamite duo at its core.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Too much romance makes the movie sag near the end and the plot could have gone in a more interesting direction. But if you are wild about Westerns, saddle up for Appaloosa.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"In all, it's a magnificent ride and certainly one of the finest films of the year.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"If a western is going to be this slow, it needs to have a lot more tension, and deeper meaning, than this one.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"A classics-steeped western that rams home tradition over reinvention, Appaloosa kicks it hard as a buddy pic on horseback. Harris and Mortensen's study in laid-back companionship is the principal pleasure, leaving Zellweger mired in role that does her and","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"As comfortable as an old saddle and as sharp as an Apache arrow, this a Western for the modern era.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,What is seductive about Appaloosa is its easygoing rhythm.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Ambition is a great quality in a filmmaker, especially when it's realized. Yet there is something to be said for just telling a story, and with Appaloosa, Harris does a fine job of it.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"Harris's adoration for the genre is clear, and his Appaloosa is a fine addition to a growing list of neo-westerns incorporating a respectful tone, ideal aim of violence, and heartfelt observation all in the same breath.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,Takes the old western conventions and juggles them in very odd but mostly satisfying ways.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"With Wayne's gruff arrogance, Eastwood's squinting revenge eyes and Stewart's ambling cool, Harris carves a daunting figure.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,Appaloosa is firmly grounded in genre orthodoxy even as it teases at the edges of nonconformity. The results are decidedly mixed.,"Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,"It's deliberately paced, but this non-Western-fan loved it.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,In its own quiet way it delivers the goods.,"Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"A warmly made, slightly offbeat movie about friendly devotion. It also happens to be a western, and every man in it is grizzled or wizened or both.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"The movie brings back the danger and the humane humor of strong, silent men of action.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"A suitable slow burn punctuated by sudden acts of violence; it fairly oozes off the screen like bloodied molasses, and then, heated, bubbles up and over, all smoke and fire and endless clouds of New Mexico dust.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Appaloosa,"The first hour bored me nearly to tears, but I'm glad I stuck it out, since the last half hour is fresh, diverting and original in the context of a neo-Western. Or a neo anything.","Action & Adventure, Western"
Appaloosa,"It isn't a bad film, but the pacing drags it down to the level of just another horse opera when it could have been so much more.","Action & Adventure, Western"

Good,"It is a fine piece of acting from Mortensen, who portrays his character's weakness superbly. But Good sometimes lacks pace and direction. On balance this is an intelligent and sensitive approach to a very dark era of history.",Drama

Good,"Mortensen isn't bad, though he looks merely absent-minded rather than anguished.",Drama
Good,"There are gripping moments of tough, muscular moral tension, mainly when Isaacs steps in, but these are dissipated by occasionally cringeworthy dialogue and a limply executed bourgeois subtext.",Drama
Good,"The original play, once dubbed one of the 100 best of the century, is fleshed out with skill by Amorim but somehow his film never comes fully to life. Even its melodramatic ending falls flat.",Drama
Good,"Despite strong performances and decent production design, Good lacks the emotional weight it needs to deliver the requisite punch. Disappointing.",Drama

The Informers,"A rancid load of swill called The Informers, from a depraved 1994 book by Bret Easton Ellis, is, like The Soloist, a look at the underbelly of L.A., but the resemblance ends there.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Informers,The dialogue is laughable. Lines are spoken so languidly that the actors seem bored. Shattering revelations are delivered in the same monotone as casual patter.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"The Informers should be more aware of its own unsavoryness, and revel in it a little. As it is, the movie is far too weighty, as though it were honestly trying to convey some kind of cautionary message.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Informers,"An outbreak of '80s nostalgia is the best explanation for The Informers, a worse movie based on a worse Bret Easton Ellis book.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"If The Informers doesn't sound to you like a pleasant time at the movies, you are right.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"In spite of the title, The Informers doesn't get below the surface of the era of Reaganesque excess to tell us anything new. But it's way cool to look at.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Informers,"A lurid, soapy, moralistic melodrama so mucky you'll need a shower.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"Directed by Gregor Jordan, Ellis's aimlessly dissolute collection of stories just doesn't hang together as a coherent whole.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"There is a weird, almost comic absence of insight and perspective here. But it is a joke without humour and without a punchline.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"This self-penned adaptation of his 1994 short story collection - a period piece set in 1983 Los Angeles - has supposedly been cut to ribbons, and it shows.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,Jordan gives all this an entirely appropriate sheen and the cast play well through glazed eyes. The film will fascinate those who love to see the tormented lives of those who seem luckier than the rest of us.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"Failing to work on so many levels, The Informers operates as a time capsule of 1983 and a time when substance was negated in favour of style. Sadly, this movie is severely lacking in both of those departments.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,For diehard Ellis completists only.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Informers,"This film is bad - really, really bad.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,A star-studded mess.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"Bret Easton Ellis pens a mean tale, in all adjectival senses. His prose is artfully maleficent; he is a laid-back Severus Snape of the sex-and-drugs generation. You need a smarter directing hand, though, than Gregor Jordan's.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"Director Gregor Jordan seems to have gone into reverse since his 2001 Buffalo Soldiers, aiming for the LA rondeau of Altman's Short Cuts but missing all the vital ingredients - wit, humanity, charm, nuance and meaning.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"The film has a slick surface sheen and evocative soundtrack (Simple Minds, A Flock Of Seagulls, etc) but those are just incidental pleasures in a languid condemnation of soulless excess.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"The Informers isn't dull but the characters are hollow and the dialogue stilted. In the hands of the film's less experienced actors, it verges on the embarrassing.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Informers,"Watching people live such vacuous, clone-like lives of privilege and decadence, it's impossible to feel anything for them.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,The Informers proves once again that Ellis's stories are difficult to realise for the big screen and perhaps best left for the printed page and the imagination.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"Much of it remains purposefully pointless, and Ellis and Jordan never attempt to reframe the dead-eyed hedonism and solipsism that makes these characters very hard to care about.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"It has a good cast and a terrific 1980s soundtrack (Devo, Simple Minds), but it also has the superficiality of a TV soap. The Informers is not so bad that you can't sit back and enjoy it, but nor is it good enough to go and see.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
The Informers,"In structure and location the film resembles Robert Altman's Short Cuts, though it's much inferior and far less interesting.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Meeting Resistance,Meeting Resistance is worth the effort. It tells a nuanced story of the Iraqi resistance that American media rarely has fleshed out.,"Documentary, Special Interest"
Meeting Resistance,This documentary does one thing and does it well. It provides first person interviews with people who were attacking U.S. military forces in Iraq in 2003.,"Documentary, Special Interest"

The Rocker,"It's modestly entertaining, occasionally funny, and generally agreeable. I just don't think Wilson should quit his day job yet.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Rainn Wilson has already been typecast as ""that weird, crazy guy"" in every role he plays, but he seems capable of more.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,It's exactly the kind of film that I'll forget having ever seen by the time Summer is over and that's too bad as I do love the premise of the film and I'm a fan of Rainn Wilson.,"Comedy, Drama"

The Rocker,"may not rock your world, but it's a sweet little fable that doesn't trouble itself with reality","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A comedy in the vein of ""School of Rock,"" ""The Rocker"" is a fine first starring vehicle for ""The Office"" star Wilson.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The timing is a bit off with this routine, even if there are a few solos that totally kick ass.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Feels like another one of those movies Will Ferrell turned down, so the producers had to find the next best thing (and Jack Black was already under contract to do something else).","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Makes up for a lack of gut-busting moments simply by being genial and smartly written. The Rocker is a minor, feel-good entertainment. It's not rocket science, but its heart is in the right place.","Comedy, Drama"

The Rocker,Audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The real problem, of course, is that Fish isn't all that interesting a protagonist.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers sitcom on the Disney Channel, The Rocker comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasn't bought music since it was sold 'on records.'","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Rainn Wilson said in an interview on The Rocker: 'There is something about a drummer. They're not cerebral. I have a tendency to be more cerebral and reserved. But he's a big puppy dog. It was lot of fun to plunge into that character.'""","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"In yet the umpteenth arrested development manchild comedy, Rainn Wilson lets his inner Jack Black out with a good dose of Will Ferrell style body barement and mines some laughs out of a largely forgettable film.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A pox on the house of the individual who first told Rainn Wilson he was a funny man. For the inconsiderate moose that decided to open their trap and inspire this actor, I wish them the same discomfort I suffered while watching The Rocker.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A wealth of creative talent can't alter the fact that Rocker is merely a passable goof-off, and one less challenging or fun than a night spent playing Rock Band.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Appeals to the part of you that dreams of stage diving, counting groupies and trashing hotel rooms.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"When the humor doesn't involve sweaty armpits or vomit, it's alternately dry, silly, and profane -- a mixed bag that will serve as a nice antidote to viewers maxed out on Apatow blue.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Breezily directed by The Full Monty's Peter Cattaneo, this amiable comedy features a solid supporting cast and the original songs, written by Chad Fischer of 'Superman' fame, are surprisingly good in a hooky, power-pop sort of way.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"School of Rock, Tenacious D and about million comedies of prolonged adolescence have stripped most of the bigger nuggets from this particular seam.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"I'm a drummer. Drummers aren't dorky. They are the heart and soul of a band, solid, dependable. Drummers aren't clueless or socially awkward. Guitarists on the other hand ...","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The film equivalent of an inoffensive throwaway track, what we used to call a B-side, back in the days of Vesuvius.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The conflicts that arise are highly predictable. But there are plenty of funny moments, as well as a sweet subplot involving the unkempt drummer and the guitarist's no-nonsense mom.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It's a film that sometimes wants to be School of Rock, sometimes wants to be This Is Spinal Tap, but ends up more like an uninspired episode of The Partridge Family.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,A grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Unfortunately, The Rocker, Wilson's first lead role in a feature film, emphasizes the wrong quirks.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"If only the movie had some bite, some edge, some anger, some insight. Instead it's generic, staying far away from the darker temptations of the rock scene.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker is an amiable comedy, so efficiently constructed that you can practically see the computer software on how to write comedy screenplays at work. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable construction.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It's too bad the unambitious Rocker didn't give those fine performers more to do. As it is, it's only half a screenplay, and theirs is the half that's missing.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,An innocuous late-summer entry that barely rises above the level of sitcom alternative to Olympic-coverage overload.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The plot is ultrapredictable, but under the gentle direction of Peter Cattaneo the movie somehow works.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker feels safe, a long way from the cutting edge, a PG guy in a PG-13 movie, a comedy with too much 'parental guidance' to be rock 'n' roll.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"If this isn't the laugh riot of the year, it's still a pleasant surprise, particularly for teen audiences. And in comedy seasons like this one, that's sometimes more than enough.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker qualifies as a B-side, but it still makes for a passable summer single.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Watching Rainn Wilson gyrate in The Rocker, you can't help wondering if Mr. Wilson is inhabiting a role that was originally turned down by Jack Black.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Manages to be a notably funnier than average summer comedy despite being a fairly shameless rip-off of School of Rock.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"While nobody's expecting This Is Spinal Tap, both the audience and the cast -- which is strong all around -- deserve better than the generic script and bland direction here.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The cinematic equivalent of elevator music: bland, occasionally entertaining and, once it's over, utterly forgettable.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It sort of gurgles, with some pleasant-sounding pops here and there. But this is essentially a film that squanders a good idea by playing things too safely.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,How much you ultimately like The Rocker will inevitably depend on how much you like Wilson. And a little goes a long way.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The film gets credit for heart, and a certain amount of rock 'n' roll spirit, but that's about it.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"You want to like almost everyone in this film, but they're all undone by a weak script that really wasn't worth more than a Gilmore Girls subplot after all.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Tuneless execution, with flat writing and inharmonious direction as noticeable as Motley Crue's eyeliner. Or Whitesnake's snakeskin pants.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It can be hard to explain what makes a star, but it's fairly easy to identify a performer who doesn't have that mysterious star stuff.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"While The Rocker may be completely unoriginal and campy at times, the film still exceeds well with great laughs and a couple of one-liners I will be adding to my collection.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Despite its breezy quality and occasional big laugh, The Rocker just never completely clicks as A-side material.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"No matter how much a movie tries to convince us, emo will never rock.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Utterly predictable, formulaic, but not entirely unamusing.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"I don't want to oversell The Rocker, but in a summer of erratic, assaultive comedies all up and down the budget scale, this Rainn Wilson vehicle -- a kind of Home School of Rock -- stakes out its own corner of the market.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,It's not exactly heartwarming to realize that The Rocker's Gen X fantasy of an escape from middle age is really a developmental nightmare.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Sadly, The Rocker is so rife with formula that a pre-school could wet nurse on it indefinitely and still never go hungry.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"...a shameless rip of ""School of Rock.""","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Some laughs, but this is no School of Rock.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"If you have marginal talent as a filmmaker, this is the kind of a film you make.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"""The Rocker"" is a likeable but sometimes awkward comedy about a likeable, awkward musician.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Sharp dialogue, knowing jabs at the music business, and a satisfying pay-off make this a late-summer pleasure that reminds us of what rocking out should be.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"I felt nothing for the characters, and worse, I didn't care if Fish confronted his old band members and got even.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Is it possible for a movie to actually kill rock n' roll?,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,One of the best things about this film is the insane commitment that Wilson has to get a laugh.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"I had a really good time watching The Rocker. I laughed, I tapped my foot to the music, and I reveled in the extraordinary Rainn Wilson.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Wilson's amiably wild-eyed performance hits all the scripted notes in a comedy that is mostly tone-deaf.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It's a slave to formula, and it hits its marks satisfyingly enough to make for a pleasant time-passer, but Wilson and a loaded supporting cast are never as funny as they should be.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,The Rocker ends up doing more to whet appetites for School of Rock 2 than it does to actually entertain.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker has the requisite vomit, the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. It's also got a vein of sweetness and charm.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"I don't doubt you can find some sort of enjoyment in watching The Rocker, but it's just one of those movies you'll forget about in a couple days.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"It's totally predictable, but if you've ever nursed a rock-star fantasy at any age, it's impossible to hate this. And the three kids are really good.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"As a satire of the music biz and in micro, long-haired heavy metal bands, the film's obviously no 'This is Spinal Tap,' and the new songs are forgettable, just like the overall film, even if (or because) Wilson does a good Jack Black impersonation.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Riff out? Please. This is about as hardcore as a wrestling match between Clay Aiken and Barry Manilow.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Memo to Rainn Wilson: A shot of a paunchy middle-aged man in jockey shorts is not automatically funny. Okay, it kind of is. But The Rocker is as formulaic as a Whitesnake song without the virtue of a four-minute running time.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,The melody of The Rocker feels predictable but the beat is refreshingly off-kilter.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Predictable, but fun.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The pratfalls and naked jokes don't eek out enough humor, and Wilson's Fish never becomes someone you can truly root for.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,There's nothing all that wrong with The Rocker. It's just that it's ordinary to a spectacular degree.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,The Rocker neither rocks nor rolls.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"To those moviegoers who've expressed some weariness of Will Ferrell and Jack Black always doing what they do: Well, OK, here's somebody else doing it.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Wilson has neither the acting chops nor musician's soul to be believable, merely a rip-off of Jack Black and Will Ferrell.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Delivers what it promises and satisfies the filmmakers' objectives (even if it isn't my kinda movie), and despite its many predictable elements, has enough entertainment value to have elicited applause from the preview audience","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,One of the problems of Peter Cattaneo's film is not knowing who it's aimed at. Kids won't identify with a bitter old rocker and the middle-aged will be hoping for more satirical Spinal Tap.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Likeable, if predictable comedy, enlivened by strong comic performances from Rainn Wilson and a talented supporting cast.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"As a movie, it may not rock, but it rolls along nicely enough.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Amiable enough yet unadventurous and uneven, this may coax the odd big smile from viewers but it never rocks the house.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"There are occasionally amusing moments, but the writing lacks the warmth that made School of Rock such a hit.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,It all looks good and there's a decent cast but nothing really takes off.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Essentially covering the same playlist as Jack Black's School of Rock, The Rocker is a good-natured, live-the-dream lark in which the one-liners score hits but the slapstick continually misses.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Just the feelgood movie that everyone needs at the moment.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The film is untidy, cheery, sometimes amiable. If only it were funny too.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Director Peter Cattaneo will probably never repeat his Full Monty success, but even in its mediocre patches one senses a renewed eagerness to entertain.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A decent US ensemble cast includes regulars from Curb Your Enthusiasm and, though the pacing is too slack, some silly one-liners help to make up for it.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker is certainly not This Is Spinal Tap, but it is fair to moderate entertainment and Rainn Wilson holds it all together energetically.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Essentially a Will Ferrell Lite movie, this toothless comedy has a likeable central performance from Rainn Wilson and several hilariously spiky side characters. But it never quite hits its comical stride.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Uh, Mr. Projectionist? Could you stop the movie? I wanna get off now.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The moments don't add up to much, though, and the dramatic arc ends up feeling even narrower than it usually is in this kind of story.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"This rock music comedy does has a few chuckles and belly laughs. And unlike a few other smug, self-satisfied comedies that have come along recently, this one at least seems to have a heart at its center.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Just when you think the dog days of summer movies are upon us along comes a hilarious sleeper hit.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"A whacked-out, superannuated, would-be rock star might seem to be too easy a comic target, but Wilson gives this sad sack so many fresh twists that he never wears out his welcome.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,Perhaps The Rocker's most annoying feature is that it isn't completely terrible.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,All premise and no purpose.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"...an agreeable, sporadically hilarious comedy that benefits substantially from the almost uniformly strong performances.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"Just because one is a scene stealer on TV does not mean he or she is big screen material, period, much less a movie star.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,More fun than a fifth of Rebel Yell and a bag of Quaaludes.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,"The Rocker is more Keane than Keith Moon: slow, safe and about as edgy as a tangerine.","Comedy, Drama"
The Rocker,It should be a fun ride but the dialogue and plot are too predictable and Wilson has no fun with the old-fogey role.,"Comedy, Drama"
The Perfect Holiday,"Spicing up Christmas with some savvy soul, are tough love story tour guide Queen Latifah, Terrence Howard as her sidekick mute meanie, and devilish duo Katt Williams and Charlie Murphy's J-Jizzy, doing musical bad boys with deliciously nasty glee.","Kids & Family, Romance"

The Perfect Holiday,"The cast is game, the script is watered nog, the kids push their charm hard, Murphy is often excruciating, Union is pleasant in a sitcom mommy way, and Lance Rivera is a zero stylist.","Kids & Family, Romance"
The Perfect Holiday,"Ostensibly a Christmastime comedy about romance, The Perfect Holiday manages to be none of the above.","Kids & Family, Romance"
The Perfect Holiday,"The actors distinguish themselves mainly by their ability to make the material, directed and co-written by Lance Rivera, seem even more painfully awkward and unfunny than it already is -- which is very.","Kids & Family, Romance"
The Perfect Holiday,"The Perfect Holiday makes the safest, blandest choices possible in delivering some Christmas cheer for the whole family.","Kids & Family, Romance"

The Perfect Holiday,"The likable cast and the script's low-key humor help, as does Howard's soulful, if fleeting, presence.","Kids & Family, Romance"
The Perfect Holiday,"[Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard] may be a draw, but it's too bad no one thought the endearing performances in this charming (if clich) family romance would be enough.","Kids & Family, Romance"

The Perfect Holiday,It's a shame that Gabrielle Union can't get better scripts than this one.,"Kids & Family, Romance"

The Perfect Holiday,Dear Santa: Please leave better scripts under her Christmas tree.,"Kids & Family, Romance"

The Box,Richard Matheson probably wouldn't care for Kelly's adaptation too much because it certainly goes its own way.

Body of Lies,"It's a film directed by one of the best directors in Hollywood, written by one of the best writers and has two of the best actors around. How could you go wrong?","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Like the intelligence officers it portrays, Body of Lies uses double-crosses and slight of hand to conceal a fairly formulaic story and a climax as offensively conventional as it gets.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Mr. Scott's professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Body of Lies,Anyone who actually sees Body of Lies will have a hard time taking it as seriously as audiences took Scott's Black Hawk Down.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Body of Lies,"Body of Lies may not tell us anything we didn't already know about the way the US does business in the Middle East, but it's compelling nonetheless.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Body of Lies,Body of Lies proves as generic as its title.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Over-directed, frequently dull and ultimately disappointing thriller that wastes the talents of its two leads and strands them with a tedious script that somehow manages to be both confusing and overly simplistic.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Ridley Scott does not reflect on causes, only on operations. Body Of Lies may engage the warrior techno-geeks, but its amorality is uninvolving.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Like Syriana without either the balls or the brains, Body Of Lies is perfectly presentable. You just expect better from the likes of Leo, Russ and Ridley.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"But despite the immaculate production values, the satire is so unspeakably crude that it ceases to matter. A shame. Scott has been an instrumental director in the Hollywood evolution of war films. But Body of Lies is a one-note rant.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Body of Lies is big and bombastic, confused and irritable - a 20th-century blockbuster struggling to adapt (too little, too late) to a 21st-century terrain.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Scott, at heart, is a pyrotechnician rather than a political philosopher. Sometimes, during the scenes when he shows graphic acts of torture, he seems like a two-penny shock merchant, too.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"With high-class acts to match the hi-tech savvy of Scott and his trusty crew (cinematographer Alexander Witt, editor Pietro Scalia, composer Mark Streitenfeld), this is as taut and engrossing a couple of hours as you'll experience all year.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Syriana, this ain't. Ridley Scott's latest misses the scope, texture or depth to dig into the moral mess of the war on terror. But this entertaining techno-thriller feeds greedily off star performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Strong.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Body Of Lies lacks the epic sweep of Gladiator and the emotional pull of Thelma And Louise. But it's enormously competent, with a couple of fine supporting performances from Crowe and Strong.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"If the starry but soulless crime flick American Gangster wasn't enough to convince you Ridley Scott was a man past his prime, check out Body Of Lies - a starry but soulless terrorism movie.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"For all the enthralling visuals and action, the film feels garbled.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Visually the film is so undistinguished it may be time for the maker of Blade Runner to be subjected to that film's Voigt-Kampff test, to determine whether the current owner of the name ""Ridley Scott"" is real or a replicant.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"But it's something of a penance to sit through, a token handwringing over American dirty tricks that's just another opportunity for Scott and co to blow stuff up.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"What's surprising is that such a heavyweight combo of Crowe, DiCaprio and Scott would waste their collective gravitas on something so light. Action and acting are both solid but there's no deeper human or political dimension to justify the running time.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,Body of Lies can't quite make up its mind whether to be an all-out thriller or a savvy political drama with something relevant to say about Muslim fundamentalism and the American response to it.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"While this film's themes seem to address issues of terrorism and CIA meddling, and the powerful cast suggests we're in Important Movie territory, the result is essentially just a routine spy thriller: entertaining but forgettable.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Better than the vast majority of the post-9/11 terrorist yarns, Body of Lies is both more ambiguous and ambitious than such heavy-handed duds as Rendition and Redacted.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Body of Lies,"For those of us who want movies to be about something and not just empty action with minimal shallow 'moral of the story' tacked on, Body of Lies is a disappointment.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Passable entertainment -- but definitely not on par with the usual DiCaprio, Crowe, or Ridley Scott output.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"A certain rawness and despairing urgency is never quite achieved for the message the film wants to deliver, and so it remains a well-intentioned, well-produced, yet generally unmemorable entertainment.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,Short on thrills and shorter on political insights,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Visually, the film is quite striking. Few modern filmmakers handle desert landscapes as well as Mr. Scott.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"It doesn't help that those action scenes all blend together, relying overmuch on speeding convoys of big black SUVs and surveillance planes that can see you picking your nose from miles up.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,...[Ridley] Scott's most entertaining and involving effort since 2001's Black Hawk Down.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Body of Lies is an extremely well paced, tightly wound, and intensely violent thriller. There is no damnation or congratulations here. As Russell Crowe muses as the end: ""No one is innocent""","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Russell Crowe has finally realised he's just an ordinary fat guy now, and taken a role he can accurately portray.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"It has none of the sweep of, say, Syriana, as if that mattered to the audience it's gunning for.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"A compelling, nail-biting spy thriller.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,Director Ridley Scott makes Body of Lies a visually stylish film that also has scenes of incredible carnage and wince-inducing torture.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"Quite frankly, it was a waste of two talented actors.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,The film's veracity is undermined by its compulsive use of glib soundbites. Not to mention an over-wound plot that begs disbelief.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"It's James Bond via today's headlines, which should, I suppose, at least make it feel very now, but it doesn't. There is nothing in this you haven't seen before, and oodles that you have.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,"A revealing, original and extremely dramatic film... [Full review in Spanish]","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Body of Lies,The action sequences lack pizzazz and feel decidedly old-hat for Scott.,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Passengers,"This middlebrow tone poem aims for ambiguity but often veers into soporific, suspending answers (and often, viewer interest) en route to an ending that explains all.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Passengers,"Anyone who doesn't see the film's ""twist"" ending coming from miles away just hasn't seen enough thrillers.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Passengers,"The film is a little too influenced by M. Night Shyamalan, which might be the wrong way to go given the reaction to his recent films.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Passengers,"She sees dead people, maybe. Stealth movie starring Anne Hathaway as the world's worst trauma counselor slipped into a few theatres without warning. Now you've been warned.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Passengers,"In addition to aspiring to be a sensitive portrait of emotional healing, it's also a supernatural mystery, a romantic comedy, a family weepy and a corporate conspiracy drama. One plot might have satisfied audiences; fractions won't.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

Passengers,"Filmmakers have the power to change reality on us at their whim, but if they do so in ways that make us feel tricked and cheated, then this is an unforgiveable rip-off.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"
Passengers,"It's a blurred pass at suspense and hesitant smooches, but with Hathaway and Wilson around to carry most of the workload, at least it's well acted.","Drama, Mystery & Suspense"

The Hammer,The movie's reliance on crass humor and long-shot solutions gradually take the charm off this underdog's blue collar.,Comedy
The Hammer,"It's no classic, but, unlike recent attempts at sports comedy (we're looking at you, Semi-Pro), The Hammer comes through by not seeming to try too hard.",Comedy
The Hammer,"The Hammer isn't going to sneak past Raging Bull in the boxing-movie pantheon (or even Rocky, for that matter). But like its star, it is an underdog you can root for.",Comedy
The Hammer,"Remaking Rocky Balboa as a comedy isn't a half-bad idea; remaking it as a comedy starring Adam Carolla, the dreadfully unfunny former host of Loveline and The Man Show, most certainly is a terrible one.",Comedy
The Hammer,There are plenty of opportunities for Carolla to spout wisdom and observations.,Comedy
The Hammer,"Working with utterly predictable material, screenwriter Kevin Hench finds plenty of offbeat humor, and Carolla knows how to make it sing.",Comedy
The Hammer,"I never would have guessed that Adam Carolla, the politically incorrect radio and TV personality, could hold his own in a movie, but here's The Hammer to prove me wrong.",Comedy
The Hammer,"Carolla is winning in The Hammer, which evokes Rocky and just about every other lovable-loser sports movie while showing enough comic originality to hold interest throughout.",Comedy
The Hammer,"A nearly comatose comedy that spends its time just bum-stumbling along, never putting in the work necessary to land a solid joke or develop a winning character.",Comedy
The Hammer,"[Adam] Carolla's grumbly, monotoned, stoop-shouldered pessimism in The Hammer, the first feature he has penned, is actually funny.",Comedy
The Hammer,"Adam Carrola makes for a pretty agreeable leading man in The Hammer, a movie tailor-made to the comic strengths of the radio/TV personality.",Comedy
The Hammer,"While this rock'em sock'em rom com about a middle-aged man's unlikely return to the world of amateur boxing doesn't quite score a knockout, it lands a respectable number of body blows -- and belly laughs.",Comedy
The Hammer,"So many movies these days are overworked or overblown: The Hammer feels genuinely tossed-off. It isn't a great movie, or even a consistently good one. Yet it gets to elusive feelings about failure and success, hope and mortality.",Comedy
The Hammer,"It's genuinely funny, oddly romantic and surprisingly engaging for what could easily have been an obnoxious vanity project.",Comedy
The Hammer,"Carolla has a tendency to riff when he should be acting, and the whole project is rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, The Hammer also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes.",Comedy
The Hammer,"The script depends heavily on familiar stand-up comedy bits, but it's full of sharp wisecracks and slacker charm.",Comedy
The Hammer,Adam Carolla fans will feel they've died and gone to heaven...Unfortunately it all adds up to something more like a viral video than a full-fledged film.,Comedy
The Hammer,"Adam Carolla isn't everyone's cup of tea, but the man can sling around an acidic one-liner with the best of them, and his starring debut is a familiar, but persuasively funny brew of clichs and belly laughs.",Comedy
The Hammer,I think it's a terrific little film.,Comedy
The Hammer,Succeeds in spite of itself.,Comedy
The Hammer,"To his credit, Carolla carries 'The Hammer' with self-assured ease, hoisting the film on his broad shoulders while making sure, as screenwriter, to leave some of its sharpest one-liners to his supporting cast.",Comedy

The Hammer,The Hammer is one of the year's nicest surprises.,Comedy
The Hammer,"Much of the film's charm comes from its scruffy, self-effacing modesty; it's a relaxed, affable underdog about a relaxed, affable underdog.",Comedy
The Hammer,"Yes, this comedy about a sad-sack, has-been boxer is painfully predictable and manages to include every cliche of the genre, but executive producer and star Adam Carolla keeps it rolling along with his trademark, deadpan rants.",Comedy
The Hammer,"One of the films that should not fly under the radar of sports comedy fans, ""The Hammer"" is a surprising good time at the movies.",Comedy
The Hammer,"It's not ""Rocky"" and it's not ""Caddyshack"", but ""The Hammer"" was a pleasant surprise and is a welcome addition to the all-too-small list of reliable sports comedies.",Comedy
The Hammer,"For anyone in their late 30s and early 40s who has seen a great deal of their lives pass them by, this can be very relateable.",Comedy
The Hammer,"The Hammer could have become a typically sappy sports flick, but [Adam Carolla] filled it with enough of his trademark humor to keep things fresh even with plotting that isn't groundbreaking.""",Comedy

The Broken,"It's not a stalker flick or a ghost story, although it's sort of a combination of both.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,While it is big on atmosphere and features crafty camerawork it is running on empty when it comes to plot.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"At it's heart there are some good ideas in The Broken but, as I said in the beginning, it's very, very slow in revealing those ideas.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"...grips your attention throughout, only to leave you unsatisfied at the end. Nevertheless, the journey is worth taking even if the destination is disappointing.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,Why the evil-doers need to do what they do is never explained. All we get is an atmospheric soundtrack desperately seeking a horror movie.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"Part mystery, part horror, it keeps us wondering what the hell is going on, while the sombre lensing ups the air of menace. The silly finale undoes a lot of the fine work, though.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"Writer-director Sean Ellis is influenced by M. Night Shyamalan, and manages an approximation of both Shyamalan's habitual look and whispery melodramatics.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"Fleeting pleasures are undermined by an inane, directionless narrative, barely-even-one-dimensional characters and an overall sense of superficiality.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"This chilling moodpiece is both psychological thriller and ghost story, with each holding up a mirror to how the other half lives.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,The tedium is almost as annoying as the sound effects.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"

The Broken,A cerebral horror that's more creepily unsettling than out-and-out scary.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"Mr Ellis has some visual flair. He builds up a menacing atmosphere, and there are a few nasty shocks. However, he seems to have no sense at all of pace or humour. His screenplay is terrible.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"

The Broken,Horror fans who like their senses assaulted slasher-style with old-school gore and lots of jumpy bits may find this cerebral affair a tad too dull for their liking.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"This unbelievably ponderous British chiller keeps priming us for some shocking revelations - oodles of ""scary"" incidental music, ominous shots of the London skyline - and signally fails to deliver them.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,Here is a film from a director with a little more imagination and skill than story-telling sense.,"Horror, Mystery & Suspense"

The Broken,"I was on board with The Broken through the first three quarters, but the sucker punch of nothingness at the end soured me on the whole thing.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"This film looks good, is capably acted and builds excellent atmosphere. And then it gets lost, and so do we.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"This rather nutty thriller begins to fall apart the more it tries to explain its premise, but it maintains a terrific sense of suspense right to the end","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"The Brken may offer a somewhat derivative resolution, but it gets there via an aptly fractured narrative, intertwining two radically different kinds of story type to disorienting effect.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"While the film might not work for fans of today's faster-paced horror/thrillers, The Broken is a creepy little pot boiler that's likely to get under the skin of many horror fans.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"
The Broken,"Ellis unblushingly borrows from older movies, from the famous (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) to the little known (Roger Moore chiller The Man Who Haunted Himself), but he does conjure up a spine-chilling frisson all his own when anyone passes a mirror.","Horror, Mystery & Suspense"

The Escapist,"Too much of this movie about prison feels only like a movie about prison, with actors posing and directors getting poetic.","Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
The Escapist,It's simply an experiment in throwing a familiar premise into a blender and seeing how it looks once it's all chopped up.,"Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
The Escapist,A customarily fine performance by Brian Cox and a well-oiled supporting cast are not enough to lift this brutal and listless prison melodrama out of the ranks of '40s B movie.,"Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
The Escapist,Shapes a standard prison-break drama into a metaphysical study of freedom and reparation.,"Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"

The Escapist,"There's an intriguing twist to this puzzling escape-from-prison drama, as Brian Cox's convincing performance propels the flasbback/flashforward suspense.","Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
The Escapist,A rousing film packed with solid performances and relentless suspense that brilliantly reinvigorates the genre of prison escape thrillers.,"Art House & International, Mystery & Suspense"
